I change my schedule so I can watch the USA play Argentina in a huge Olympics match-up. I sit down in front of myTV, and flip through the NBC Olympic Multiplex of channels. I’m excited about the game. With no Mavs playing, I can watch and not be worried about injuries, and I love the team basketball and how hard our guys play.
I flip, no game  anywhere.
I go to the website. It’s the end of the first quarter already.
I’m sure it’s a rating decision for NBC, and they will show the game, and/or highlights later. I can understand what they are doing. They have many events, and they want to maximize their return on their investment. Smart business on their end.
I wish the NBA had the same sense. We are now at a point where we have more than 500mm dollars in NBA salaries tied up and at risk in this game, and we can’t even watch it live. In fact,we have no idea how much of the game we will be able to see.
So explain to me why we are putting at risk, more than half a billion dollars in salaries that we are obligated to pay and many of our most important NBA players. Why are we making money for the, “we will sue you if you have a ring or use the word Olympics in your business,” Olympics and their partners?
The visibility????
