People always ask me for reading suggestions, so here are 2 very simple ones:
The first is one of the best stockmarket columns available. This guy doesn’t get the credit he deserves, but in my opinion his column is a must read. His name is Chris Byron, and he writes about stocks and the markets forThe NY Post.
Chris unlike many has no problems taking on issues that aren’t popularbut that protect the individual investor. His column todayshould be required reading for any small investor thinking of investing in penny stocks. He nails the problems with Reg D offerings, gives examples and most importantly follows up to confirm just how slimely some companies are that are using this instrument.
The SEC might not watch out for small investors, but it’s great to know that Chris is. Read his column!
