We have worked hard. the adrenalin is pumping. I got to check out my costume for tonight. Which is pretty cool. not something people are going to expect from me. We have really changed up the look. Hope you like it !
I have to be down in rehearsal in about 20 mins. Believe it or not, this is a little bit more nerve racking than last week. This morning we got to work with the orchestra for the first time. Well after we went through it once. At the same speed as the CD they gave us (ABC picks the music btw), Kym really felt that the tempo of the song was too slow. So boom, she got the orchestra to speed it up. 
Easy for them, not so easy for me. Its not a little bit faster, its A LOT faster. Fortunatey , after dress rehearsal, we will have about 90 minutes and kym and i can try to work on the little things that were based on timing. Talk about a challenge !
It still wont change the fact that I am going to go out there and have a blast. HOpefully the smile will be big enough you wont notice if Im a little off in a few places..
And of course, DWTS is all about the vote. I need everyone to get everyone to dial 1 800 VOTE 411 tonight from 8pm EST to 9:30EST and then go to abc.com and register as many addresses as you own and vote for Kym and I !
Here is the link to register
and one more thing. Win Lose or Draw, I canâ€™t tell you how important all the posts and emails of support have been over the last week.  That have meant a lot to me. Thank you so much !
