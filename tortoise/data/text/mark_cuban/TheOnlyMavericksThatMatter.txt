Is our Dallas Mavericks.  The Preseason starts tonight. Not only can I not wait to get things rolling, but I can not wait for the election to be over.  Watching Tina Fey on SNL is hysterical, but its time to return the Maverick name where it truly belongs.  On our jerseys.
Any one know of any decent players named McCain and Obama that I can sign for the preseason  ?
Should I just put McCain on the back of a Mavericks jersey and have someone selling them at Republican rallies and on their website ?? Now thats an idea !
Think Tina Fey of SNL might have some fun with that ?
Go Mavs !
