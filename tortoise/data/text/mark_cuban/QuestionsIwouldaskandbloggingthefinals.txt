these are days when you wish cloning was legal and possible. Whether in person , phone or email, the questions asked leading up to the finals are the same over and over again. A Stepford Mark would be highly desirable right about now.
  To show everyone the depth of my reporting instincts, Im going to offer the questions I would offer the person who is probably taking the biggest onslaught of media, Shaq.
  Here are the questions I want answers to from Shaquille:
  1. Shaq ‚Äì You have several young children. Which Wiggles song is your favorite ? Which do you like the least ?  2. How many times have you had to watch Ice Age and did you take your kids to see Ice Age 2 ?  3. Are your kids so big they are confused with kids twice their age ?  4. Have you ever been contacted to turn Kazaam into an off Broadway musical ? Has anyone sampled Shaq Fu in a hit song yet ?  5. Will you admit in public that you have hummed Barney‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Love You‚Äù song to yourself in a game ?
  I could go on, but Ive shown off enough üôÇ
  And as far as blogging the finals. Im deciding if blogging at half time from the home games is a good idea or not‚Ä¶
  And the big question is, where are you going to watch the game this Thursday and with who ??
