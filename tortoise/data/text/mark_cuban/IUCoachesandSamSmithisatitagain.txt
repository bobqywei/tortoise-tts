I have to give Sam Smith credit. If he wants to be a nuisance, all he has to do is make up something in his column about me, and he knows I will get flooded with emails about it.
So he makes up a complete lie in one of his columns about me supporting Randy Wittman for the head coaching job at Indiana.
I like Randy. I think he has been a good coach in the NBA.
That said, I havent and wont put my support behind any given coaching candidate. Im not prepared to understand what makes a good recruiter or a good coach in the college ranks.
So i dont pretend to.
Im an IU fan. Whoever the school hires, that is my favorite Indiana coach, and thats who i will support until he or she isnt the Indiana coach.
its that simple
