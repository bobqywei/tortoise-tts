One of the fun things at HDNet is listening to or reading pitch ideas for new shows. One of the most irritating and time wasting jobs at HDNet is listening to or reading pitch ideas for new shows.
99pct of the time the idea is a derivative of something that is already being done, or something so obvious its an insult that they are pitching it.  I dont need to be pitched another cooking, poker, pimp my whatever, American Idol knockoff, nor do I want to hear another “compete for a Mavs roster spot” or “business plan competition idea”. 
What I would like to read are original show ideas. So post them if you got them. 
If they have anything to with sports or a deck of cards,  i don’t want to read them and they will be deleted.  
If its obvious you don’t know anything about HDNet or have never seen our networks , it will be deleted. All of which is a subtle guide that doing your homework about HDNet will help you. Being a regular viewer, as I know many of you are, will help you even more.
I would love to be able to come back and write a post about how we are developing, or have picked up a show based on a comment posted to the blog. Somebody give me a reason !
