Transparency is key to the success of the Bailout and related loans and investments the government makes with our tax dollars. Without complete transparency, we will get from our government what we always get when it comes to finances, confusion. To do my part, Iâ€™ve worked with the folks at Sharesleuth.com to create Bailoutsleuth.com
Its job is simple, keep an eye on our taxpayer dollars and call Bullshit when necessary.
if you take a trip over to Bailoutsleuth you can see that its already time to call BS. In the first contract handed out, in this case to Bank of NY Mellon Corp, the compensation section is blacked out.
Sad. So very sad, that we couldnt make it a week without being afraid of the very taxpayers who are footing the tab for all of this.
Bailoutsleuth will try to publish every day in keeping up with how our taxdollars are spent and the people and companies that are impacted by this program. We are still a work in progress and look forward to your comments , feedback and tips.
