Time to get past the Dress Code stuff. It is what it is. Which is not that big a deal.
Its a shame the owners let it come to this, because it created a distraction and took attention away from our NBA Cares program. ( This is a trend analysis comparing blog mentions of each)
Some players arent going to like it, but they will comply. Some guys wont care because they wear suits anyway. The one thing I have to go on the record as saying is that the Dress Codeid not racist. Stephen Jackson is wrong. Ugly Wrong. The Dress Code may be Ageism (if thats a real word), but racist it was not.
This was no different than those moralistswho tried to ban Elvis from the Ed Sullivan show, which lead toElvis only being shown from the waist up, for fear his wiggling hips might corrupt America. It earned him the nicknameElvis the Pelvis.
Now grandmothers listen to Elvis gladly. Im sure the same people who think a dress code is a neccesity in the NBA, consider Elvissafe music, hope their grandkids listento it and have completely forgotten all the sex, drugs and rock n roll that Elvis lived by. Hypocritical. In many ways. Its amazing how much context we lose as we age. The good ole days, never were, but we sure want them to be.
There is a long , long list of examples over the past 50 years of generational mistrust, and that is exactly what the NBA Dress code is all about. This isnt about race. Its about generational disconnect and the NBA didnt know any other way to deal with it. And thats the end of it.
