I can’t thank everyone who voted via phone or email for Kym and I as much as I would like to. To say I was surprised to not only move on, but to not be under the red light would be an understatement. I thought there was a good chance we were goners. The only reason we weren’t is because of your votes. THANK YOU.
I wish I had the energy to write more , but I have been up for 36 straight hours and I need to crash.
After the show last night we practiced from 9pm to 11:30, i got back to the hotel around midnight. That would not ordinarily be of note, but I had committed to do interviews with the media on the east coast to discuss our moving forward on the show and my new hip. Being in LA, doing early morning East Coast shows meant being up at 3:30 to start interviews before 5am LA time. I tried to get 3 hours of sleep. I didnt get any.
The interview sessions lasted till about 9:15 and from there I went to start rehearsing with Kim. That lasted till about 4pm. It wasnt all that productive, by the end I was like a zombie.
So here I sit in my hotel, tapping this post out with toothpicks keeping my eyes open. I didnt want anyone to think I didnt appreciate all the support Kym and I received. 
As I told every entertainment and news show that interviewed us after the show and this morning, the support of people who read this blog, the support of the many bloggers who got behind Kym and I and the Facebook and Myspace nations and networks that rallied behind us are what kept us alive on the show.
The Nerd Herd was in full effect. This was truly an internet showing and I cant thank everyone enough and I truly hope we earn the same level of support next week.
Time for me to get some sleep
