I haven’t done the research to find out when the last time 7 games separated one conference’s top 10 teams, all with a winning record and playing good basketball this late in the season.  It hasn’t happened in the 8 years I have owned the Mavs.
This year is shaping up to be a crazy one. A 5 or 6 game losing streak and any of the 4 teams who have had the best record in the west over the past month could find themselves out of the playoffs. 
This scenario is not lost on players or fans. The feel in  arenas lately have been very playoff like. You can feel the energy as fans know what is at stake.  Players are looking at the standings and paying far closer attention to game by game results of division and conference teams. They know what is at stake with every game.
This season, at least in the Western Conference, no one is going to ask the question of whether the regular season is important. For the remainder of this season, EVERY game is important.  Every team will have their up and down streaks simply because its going to be hard to play playoff quality basketball for 40 games.  Back to back games in the West are going to be brutal.
The playoffs to make the playoffs has started and it doesn’t look like any team will get a breather between now and when their season ends.That will make this the Best NBA Season Ever !
