Ok, this is a shameless plug, I will admit it. If such things turn you off, read no further.
If however, you are interested in what is happening in the blogosphere, then read on.
At IceRocket.com, we have just completely rewritten and reindexed our blog searching ability so that we now reach more than 10mm blogs. That right, with every portal nowwith their own blog hosting offering, we have passed the 10mm mark.
If you have an interest in what the Bloggers of the World are saying about you, your team, your family, your favorite celeb, breaking news or any topic that comes mind, we are easily the best way to find out.
Not only can you easily search for key news topics like “The Pope’s Funeral” to find out who is there, what they are seeing and saying…or get the latest news on the “MGM vs Grokster Case“, you can also celeb hunt and or even find out what people are saying about your fave TV show, your soon to be favorite movie Enron – The Smartest Guys in the Room (premiering April 22nd) or about you!
In addition to covering every inch of the blogosphere, if you have a search you use repeatedly and want to keep up to date, we allow you to subscribe to the search and add it to My Yahoo or your favorite RSS reader.
I use this to keep up with stocks – bloggers often have better information than stock analysts. I use it to find out what people are saying about me, the Mavs and my other businesses, and to keep up with the latest technology from tech bloggers.
Check it out and let me know what you think. We continue to work hard to make it a great resource that everyone can use. And while you are at it, check out our websearch (with RSS feeds as well), and our image search (whichI think blows google’s away).
