This blog has generated a lot of great feedback from high school, college and recreational officials. Consider this a test of your knowledge of NBA rules. I’m hoping to get feedback from all of you who have a tape or TiVo of our game 4 last night on plays that occured at the times listed below.
I haven’t heard back yet from the NBA on their position on the calls, so it will be interesting to compare the emails and comments I get versus what the NBA comes back with.

Thanks in advance for the feedback. It’s what makes blogging fun! For those that don’t have a tape or TiVo of the game,I wishI could provide one, butI can’t.
