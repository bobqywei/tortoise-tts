Can I be the first to say that “Harry is the Man !”  Putting the obvious reasons aside, I also want to be the first to suggest that we ask, and beg Harry to accept a newly created Presidential Financial Oversight Advisor position.  Is there a better person to make sure that the oversight committees appointed to watch how the TARP and Stimulus is spent do their jobs ?  Is there a person any of us would trust more to tell the politicians in Wall Street “How to tell if the oversight committees can  “sit down in Fenway Park and find first base ?” To make sure there are appropriate levels of transparency ? 
Keep your day jobs Harry. Do what you do.  But give us taxpayers a ray of hope that our money won’t all be wasted.
And when you get the oversight committees working, can we talk about balancing the budget ?
