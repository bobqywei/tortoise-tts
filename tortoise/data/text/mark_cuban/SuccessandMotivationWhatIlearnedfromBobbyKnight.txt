Congrats on more wins than any other coach in NCAA Div 1 Basketball. Thats quite an accomplishment. 
There are a lot of things I could say thank you for. The great times watching IU Basketball. (even though I wasnt a fan when I got there. I thought any team with Kent Benson should go undefeated). 
The first time I met you at IU at the Deans residence where they tried to butter me up with a fancy lunch and we both showed up in sweaters. (AT least I got to wear jeans üôÇ
The time you spent talking to me down in Miami.
But thats not really what I appreciate most about you.
When I was at Indiana you were on 60 Minutes. In your interview you said one single thing that I took to heart. I reminded myself of it while it was in school at Indiana. I reminded myself of it when I failed. I reminded myself of it before any of the many businesses I have started I will continue to remind myself before any of my endeavors going forward. Its also the best advice I‚Äôve been able to give people of any age who ask me for advice. 
Its also the characteristic I look for when choosing a partner or hiring. I saw it in Avery Johnson. Ive seen it in Phil Garvin. It was obvious in Todd Wagner and Martin Woodall and many, many others that have put me in a position to succeed.
You said, and Im paraphrasing: ‚ÄúEveryone has got the will to win, its only those with the will to prepare that do win‚Äù
Words for every athlete and those of us who partake in the Sport of Business to live by
Thanks Coach.
