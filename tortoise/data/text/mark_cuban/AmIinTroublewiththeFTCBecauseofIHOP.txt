Ok, so here is the deal. I really, really like going to IHOP for breakfast. I go there all the time because they have this  omelette that only has 370 calories and I think it tastest great ! (especially with Salsa).  I liked it so much i tweeted about it a little while back.
So today, I went back again. Had the omellete and a large fruit bowl. Total listed calories, 480. Perfect. Tastes good. Low cal.
Then horror of horrors, the manager comped my breakfast.
He couldn’t understand why I was visibly shaken.  I thanked him. Left a $20 tip (i wanted to be able say I left enough to more than pay for the meal).  Then I immediately called my law firm of Bakem, Shakem and Takem and had them assign their best attorneys to figure this out.
I don’t know what my disclosure requirements are going forward and whether or not I need to fill out any forms.
Can I tweet about IHOP again after Dec 1st ? Am I under some special reporting obligation ?
Does any one have any connections at the FTC that can clarify things for me ???? I read this article, and I just dont know what to do !
Im open to all advice !!
