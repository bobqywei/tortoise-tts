Portable media devices, whether Ipods, portable gaming devices, phones with all their features, or whatever have solved what has been a generations old nuisance for all of us, boredom.
We have our little devices and now we are never bored. We dont find ourselves staring off into space unoccupied, wondering what to do. We dont find ourselves muttering about how bored we are sitting on the train, or on a plane, trying to do anything to make the time go by more quickly.
Our little mobile devices are so popular because they are the ultimate, continuous distraction. They are the easiest cure for boredom.
Check your email. Call your friend. Play a game on your phone or PSP. Watch a movie on your Ipod. It doesnt matter where you are anymore. You always have at least one.
When we leave the house now, its keys, wallet, phone/pda/IPod, lock the door. The minute we have nothing better to do, or our mind starts to wander, regardless of where we are, meetings, events, elevator, exercise bike, walking down the street, out it comes.
When we have to do something that we want to go by quickly, like those 45 mins on the bike. Out it comes. You dont care how big the screen is, you just want to be distractedâ€¦and maybe catch up on your favorite show or watch the video of the kids soccer match
We are going to become increasingly dependent on these devices not because we think they are amazing or wonderful, but because they are there. They do their job. They distract us.
Portable video will be successful not because it will siphon off viewing from traditional tv. Portable video sells and will sell in increasing numbers because its a better cure for boredom, and a better distraction than just music, or just a phone, or just games.
Daydreaming and zoning out arent dead and gone, but they now have a soundtrack anda video
