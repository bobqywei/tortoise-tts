I get pitched continuously. Email after email.  99pct get deleted within 10 seconds. Some repeat offenders get filtered directly to spam.
The quickest way to get deleted and filtered as permanent spam is to send me an email a 2nd time and comment that you are going to show me some  “perseverance” and continue to send me the email till I respond.  Why do people think this will work ? .  For those of you who are not smart enough to figure it out,  it is not perseverance to resend an email to someone, anyone, multiple times. Its LAZINESS . Lazy people think they are working hard when they hit the send key. That’s not work.  That’s wasting time. That’s the lesson of the day.  Sending the same email over and over again not only shows you to be lazy and annoying, but it gets you sent directly to spam.
Now for a sales letter so bad it went from humorous to disturbing.  I have marked my comments with an *
Good morning Mark,
I spoke to your very capable secretary Nancy earlier today.
*I dont have  a secretary named Nancy*
As a former active Attorney, Real Estate Broker and Advisor with Merrill Lynch,
I believe I have a unique insight into the next big moves in Stocks and Precious metals.
While I do not have a “crystal ball”, I do my homework.
 *Nothing unusual so far, but then all of the sudden, the letter gets bizarre.  He starts pimping out his daughter for no reason I can figure out *
I have a daughter, Cxxxxxxxxxx, who is a senior in high school.
Two years ago after being chosen by Coca Cola to do a multi-media modeling
Campaign focused on the Olympics in China, she had her ACL ligament severed in a soccer incident. In the Junior
Miss  Pageant she won Best Actress and was in the top 10 overall.
She was a model with Elite in XXXXXXX.
You should see her photographs; Facebook:  XXXXXX,  in YYYYY City
****Im sorry, the whole daughter thing was incredibly disturbing to me*
I plan on specializing in this sector for the next 5 years.
*** IN what , pimping your daughter ?****
I have attached charts for Gold and Silver which go back to 1980.
*How did we get to gold and why ? The simplest search on my name and gold shows I am not a fan of gold. Never will be.***
Gold has made Highs in Jan 1980, 88, 96, 04, 2012?
Gold has made Lows in Jan  1985, 93, 01, 09, 2016?
Silver spent 11 years building a descending wedge from 1980 to 1991.
Silver spent 11 years building a base from 1991 to 2002.
From 2002, the next 11 years are likely to be bullish.
The long term cycle high is due in 2013.
For 9 of the last 10 years Silver has shown Seasonal strength from the end of October
to the end of May with an average gain of 21.4%.  (Financial Post, December 8, 2009)
Gold Beats All in Decade of â€˜Fear and Greedâ€™: Chart of the Day
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=email_en&sid=aHuMwsIjMF.U
Please click on the link above.
Investors who bought gold or commodities at the beginning of the decade should
have tripled their money by the time the ball drops in New York’s Times Square
on Dec. 31.
Gold has increased more than 380 %
Silver has roughly tripled.
Stock holders have lost approximately 10% in the decade.
We are now entering the 2nd quarter of the Bull market in Gold and Silver.
Historically when Gold makes major high, the Gold/Silver ratio approaches 40.
Gary Savage thinks the ratio could press below 40.
See: www.garyscommonsense.blogspot.com
On a percentage basis, Silver has far more upside than Gold.
Have a great New Year and a Better Decade than the last one.
Very Best Regards,
***So the guy pimps his daughter. Sends me a bunch of charts and info on Gold and Silver and then says good bye.   Dont try this at home or work ***
