I had a couple reasons to go back and look at some old presentations and speechs I gave during the Broadcast.com and my few Yahoo days. I was curious to see if anything i predictedended up happening, and how off i was on everything else.
It was kind of interesting, and even refreshing in some cases. Rather than rehash them all, i decided to take advantage of my buddies over at Box.net, with whom I back up my life, and just let them host the files and let you download them.
I doubt they will be as entertaining to others as they were to me, but heck, you never know. Flashbacks can be fun

And of course, feel free to sign up for an account at Box.net, or if you want need something that fits more into a corporate, rather than individual online hosting environment, you can try out the in depth storage options at filesanywhere.com
