  Typically when someone on TV talks about a team being young or old, they just take the average age of everyone the
  roster. Which of course is a worthless number. If your youngs never play, your team is older than your average. If
  the old guys never play, its younger than its average.
To find out where all the teams stood, i went through and took the age of each player on dec 31st and multiplied
  by the number of minutes they have played and calculated the weighted average age for each team.
These charts are going to look confusing unless you are into numbers, but the numbers are interesting. The teams
  are ordered from youngest weighted average age to oldest. All teams show the most used lineup in minutes, except for
  the MAVs. I just picked a lineup but excluded numbers. Hey, this is competitive info …..
