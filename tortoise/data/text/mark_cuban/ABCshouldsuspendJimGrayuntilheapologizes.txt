I didn’t catch this while it was happening, but thanks to Adam W for emailing me and bringing it to my attention. I know I said chemistry was better this year, but made zero mention of Steve Nash in my comments regarding chemistry.
I will just go with Adam’s Email to say it all
During yesterday’s game vs. Houston (no commment) Jim Gray said something very interesting. the summary of it was something to the affect of
JG: Dirk, I asked Mark [Cuban]and Finley if team chemistry was better without Nash, would you agree:
DN: No I don’t think so (with a puzzled look on his face)
Now if I recall when Jim Gray talked to both you and Fin there was no mention of Nash in his chemistry statement. He just asked if team chemistry was better.
I thought Jim Gray was a solid reporter (if thats what you call him) but this was ridiculous.”
Obviously I trust Adam to report accurately more than I trust Jim Gray.
What Gray did is pretty much the definition of slime reporting. I will talk to Dirk about it, but for a reporter or whatever he calls himself to misrepresent an interviewee’s comments in orderto elicit an emotional or controversial response is wrong.
ABC Sports should take immediate action against Jim Gray and suspend him from working until he apologizes to Dirk and Mavs fans.
