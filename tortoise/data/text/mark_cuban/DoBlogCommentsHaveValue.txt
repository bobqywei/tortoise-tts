The surest way to get called names is to blog about something that people do or may disagree with. It doesnâ€™t matter what the topic is. It can be technology, sports, dancing, TV and probably something as benign as pizza.
The Hate and Noise to Content ratio seems to be increasing daily. The reality is, there is no such thing as a widely read blog without moderated comments that is profanity or hate free. Thats a shame.
So the question is, is it  worth  it to allow unmoderated comments ?  Or is babysitting comments just part of the job of bloggers ? Or are comments just a waste of time under all circumstances ?
