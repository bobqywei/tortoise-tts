I was thinking of ideas on how to add twitter and/or facebook fan page followers. I dont have a real need to have to do so. I was just curious about ways to do so.
Think of it as one of those things my minds wanders off to while Im working out.
One thing that poppedup as what I thought was a decent idea was the idea of  rewarding those who refer and/or generate followers to my pages on twitter (@mcuban), or on FAcebook (/markcuban) a unique page where they were the only person approved to have access and for some period of time, they would have exclusive access for questions and answers.
So for instance, if you helped me add 1k followers on twitter, i would create a new ,private account on twitter and you would be the only approved follower. You could ask me anything and I would respond for some period, probably 24 hours. After which I would replace you with another follower. I could do the same on facebook.  I would set up a private account and only friend this person.  Using the wall, we could have an exchange about any subject.
Good idea or bad idea ?
