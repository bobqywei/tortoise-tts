I’ve watched with interest, Chad Pennington’s battle with the NY media. Chad chose not to talk to reporters after the Jets beat the Seahawks this past week. Apparently it was in response to Troy Aikman telling him that the NY Media was treating them “as if they hadnt won a game all year”.
As the Jets Quarterback in NYCity, I can only imagine the idiocy he has to deal with from the media after every game.It’s amazing that more players in NY don’t invoke the Rasheed Wallace clause and just tell reporters that “both teams played hard”. So needing to take a day off certainly isn’t a suprise.
I just wish Chad had talked to me before he lifted his boycott.
Chad, you can’t boycott the media, and then try to explain yourself through the same. To do so is to put yourself at their mercy. The minute you took questions and gave answers, you left yourself wide open for them to use your words against you. They certainly weren’t going to print the transcript of the media session in their papers. It all turns into an opportunity to have fun with you, at your expense
Chad, you need to start a blog.
You need a place where you can explain yourself. You can write as much or as little as you would like, but the words will be all yours. You can create the context. You can make sure that all issues are addressed. You can take issue with individuals, or the media as a whole. Your words, your message.
As the starting quarterback of the Jets, it will get read. It will get referenced. It will give you balance against the “power of the pen”, in a voice that can’t be misquoted or referenced out of context.
If you need any help setting it up, just drop me an email!
