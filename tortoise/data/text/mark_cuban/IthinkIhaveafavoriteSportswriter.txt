Finally, a sportswriter/columnistI look forward to reading. No wasted time on trying to break scoops or reporting 9th party rumors from friends of friends that they met in a bar. There is finally a column thatI look forward to reading because the author actually looks for new information about how the game of basketball is being played in the NBA.
Someone who actually takes the time to look for information that has impact and substance rather than writing the 15 mins to deadline column.

IfI can rail on them, I have to praise the ONEI find to be my first read.
Congrats
