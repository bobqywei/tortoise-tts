It’s time for my ref stat updates. As usual no names, no claims, just the facts and nothing more or less!

This week holds lots of fun facts that you can inspire your friends with.

Total fouls called are down vs last year, with an average of 46.47 in total fouls being called per game (compared to 48.17 this time last year). 

The average number of calls by the 3 veteran officials who call the most total fouls is about 51, with the high being his crews calling 52.07 fouls per game. On the low side, the average of veteran officials who call the least fouls is about 42.5 for their crews. Suggesting a variance in foul calls between certain veteran officials can run approximately18 pct from game to game.

The average number of travels called this year is 2.49. (Thank you NBA  for eliminating the “why don’t you call traveling, it’s a bad example” emails!) This compares to 2.1 at the end of last year. The variance between high and low, is 4.17 for one veteran officials crews and 1.44 for another veteran officials crew. Meaning that the highest officials’ crews will call travelling almost 3x as often as the official whose crews call it the least.
