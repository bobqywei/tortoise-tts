Larry Brown raised the point after game 2 vs the Spurs that the Pistons were 1-7 when Danny Crawford or Ron Garretson officiated their playoff games. Of course we all know that it’s just happenstance that its turned out that way.If the Pistons just happen to play poorly when one of those two officials were on the court, that’s just the way it goes…..
Since Coach Brown brought it up, I decided to update the Mavs “standing by official” for playoffs since the 2001 season, when we played the Twolves in the first round.
Here is our win loss record when any of the following officials are on the court in the games that have occured since then.
Our total record during those playoff runs is 21 Wins and 25 Losses.
It’s just interesting information that I thought you might be curious to see and would be fun to talk with friends about over a beer.
