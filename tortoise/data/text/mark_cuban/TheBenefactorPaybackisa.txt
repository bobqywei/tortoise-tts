Down to the final 6. SorryI couldn’t give an update on the in-depth reasons behind some of the cuts. Things have been crazy with Mavs training camp starting tomorrow. I did want to give some highlights to watch out for, kind of a cheat sheet for blogreaders. The action gets far more intense now that it’s down to the final six, with at least 1 more to go TONIGHT!
Here is what you can expect in upcoming episodes:  ***I get my hair colored…pink.  ***The Lies continue…and mount.  ***One contestant reveals a 2nd personality and it was truly bizarre to be there when his/her family confirms it…and there are pictures to prove it.  ***Finally, and this is my favorite, when we sent out the review tapes, we put out some extra footage on there as a misdirect. The footage is wrong. It was a little twist we hoped a bunch of media would fall for. Turns out, Entertainment Weekly and a few others took the bait. Let’s see if they admit it.
Spread the Benefactor love Mondays on ABC. TiVo it. Tell your friends to watch too and let me know what you think about tonight’s episode!!
