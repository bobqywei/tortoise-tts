The World Wide Leader in Sports is without question minor league when it comes to ESPN Dallas.
I only care about the coverage of the Dallas Mavericks.  From ESPN Dallas, its non existent.  Its hard to offer any coverage when you dont actually have anyone at the games.  Last two Mavs games. No local reporter.  Maybe the ESPN Dallas standard of coverage is to have their reporters watch the game on TV. IN which case I guess I should be happy since most of the preseason games  are on HDNet.
The Dallas Morning News on the other hand has the ever reliable Eddie Sefko and apparently is adding more coverage to the Mavs.
Maybe this newspaper vs internet thing is changing.  The newspaper is adding people who will actually attend games. The world wide leader in sports thinks its acceptable to not send reporters to the game and instead have them report from what they watch on HDNet.
The impact of this approach isnt just about the coverage Mavs fans get.  It also impacts the business decisions the Mavs make. We have already beefed up significantly the behind the scenes, interviews and game highlights video and reporting we offer on Mavs.com, and via a wide assortment of twitter options from our broadcast crew and others.   And we will continue to add more.
Behind the scenes it impacts who gets the “scoops”.  If we have just done something, trade, signing, whatever. Guess who gets the heads up email first ? The website with no one at our games, or the Newspaper/website with more than one reporter at our games ?
I hope ESPN Dallas decides to make a commitment to the Mavs, the more Mavs coverage the better. But until they do..
If you are a Mavs fan, diehard or casual, make your first stop Mavs.com and your next stop The Dallas Morning News, or just open up your morning newspaper.
