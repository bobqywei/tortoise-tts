I wrote a post a while back about How to Get Rich.  The no shortcuts version. It is posted below. I wanted to repost it because its been so popular in the archives. Plus, with the advent of some new banking laws, I wanted to update it with a quick note.
On July 1, laws for banks change so that they can not charge you overdraft fees UNLESS YOU OPT – IN. In other words, if you want your bank to give you cash at an ATM, or cover a debit charge on your debit card when there isn’t enough money in your account to cover it, you have to give the bank permission to do so. When you give that permission, you also give them permission to charge you HUGE amounts of money in the form of an Overdraft Charge. When I say HUGE, I mean HUGE. To the impact of 10s of Billions of Dollars per year in revenue for banks.
If you want to get rich, one of the first steps you need to take is NOT OPT IN. No matter how the banks package and market the benefits and wonders of overdrafts at the ATM or on your debit card, don’t fall for it !
Thats the How to get Rich lesson for the day. Dont be an overdraft sucker !
And here is a repost of my How to Get Rich post from 2008
