Some of the stuff i write is good. Some of it aint. Some I write because i want to make a point. Some I write because I want to get feedback and learn more.
Some have turned into favorites. Given ive been writing this going on 2 years now, i decided to bring back a couple faves and provide links to them.
First on my list are the posts Ive written about Success & Motivation. I get so many questions about how I got”lucky” so many times,things I have done that have worked or not.Experiences I have had. This series of entries, written more than a year ago, I think,bring back some great memories for me and I think are worth sharing again.
