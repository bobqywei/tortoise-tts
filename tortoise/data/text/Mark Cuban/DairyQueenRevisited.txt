If the league hadnâ€™t fined me $500,000 dollars I would let this little note just slide by and not mention it. Given their reaction to my comments suggesting that this individual could not manage a Dairy Queen, I find it relevant to mention that he has since had a career change.
The former NBA head of officiatingleft his position at the NBA to becomean assistant football coach at Bloomsburg University in Pa.
I wish him all the best in his new career and wish he would have started it sooner. It would have saved me a lot of money.
