The braintrust at the NBA never ceases to amaze me. I know David Stern and Adam Silver cant keep their eyes on everything. Sometimes i wish they would. The marketing mavens once again proved they are in the wrong job with the All Star Ballot.
  Simple in concept. Difficult in execution. Right ? Its an incredible stretch Im sure for those on this project to have recognized that when the Suns said WEEKS before the season started, that Amare Stoudamire would be out until around the All Star breakâ€¦that maybe that would be an indicator that he wouldnt have a season that would qualify him for the All Star team.
  Yah Think ?
  But no. They put Amare on the ballot. After all, its much better to possibly be in a position where fans could vote Amare in. Right ? That would really validate the process.
  Of course it must have been because there was no one else to place on the ballot ? I mean why in the world would they add an all NBA quality defender who is putting up double doubles like Josh Howard ? Did they miss Josh Howard in the playoffs last year ?
  Im not saying that Josh will be voted in by the fans. thats a long shot. But there is no question that he deserved to be on the All Star ballot. Players around the league recognize his talent, and we at the Mavs certainly do.
  shame the NBA shot an airball on it
