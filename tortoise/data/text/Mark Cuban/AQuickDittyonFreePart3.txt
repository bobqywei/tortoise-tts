When a topic is fun. Its fun. So why not write some more about it.
Im guessing that write now some kid is writing a facebook clone, that probably uses FaceBook Connect and tell his or her friends that it will be just like FaceBook, except that you have to be in school.  You have to use a .edu email address in order to be able to take part in this new social network.
No parents.  No grandparents, no aunts or uncles out of school. Your boss from McDonalds cant peak, and best of all, when you graduate, those same people wont be able to see any of the stupid pictures you posted when you were drunk.
Of course the irony is that this is exactly how facebook got started. You had to have an edu email address until a few years ago.
In the world of free, today’s products are tomorrow’s product features. You have to keep growing and growing so that your advertising revenue covers the company’s growing expenses and expectations rather than accepting the product lifecycle and using it to your financial advantage.
Here is a question for you. Which choice would have created the greatest return for Facebooks Investor’s, staying focused on the .edu subset of users they started with, or being on the growth treadmill that has required them to raise who knows how many hundreds of millions of dollars ?
