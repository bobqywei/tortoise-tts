I promise never to complain about the weather in Dallas again. Dang. This must be the opposite of a dry heat. I l ove Miami. Have a condo here. Love to visit. BUt i prefer not to have to swim through humidity !
  Any, game time countdown 3 hours and counting. Wont be able to blog during the game, Im not going to bring a laptop to the arena. I will bring my new sidekick 3. Got an early edition. I love to play with new toys, and this one is off to a great start. Its also a great way to make the time till tip off go faster. Otherwise I would go crazy.
  YOu want to say that this is a huge game tonight. But why. EVERY game in the finals is huge. HUGE HUGE HUGE.
  THey are going to come out playing out of their minds. The crowd is going to be nuts. We have to be able to take the early barrage of punchs.
  GO MAVS !
