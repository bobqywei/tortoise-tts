The first question every always ask me is “Why ?”, Why would I do it ? The answer is simple.Because I can. 
It actually is more surprising to me that some people would even think twice if asked to participate on the show. 
I’m the first to admit that I’m the luckiest guy in the world. I can honestly say I wake up every morning with a smile knowing what a wonderful family, friends and life I have. It’s the exact same way I felt when I was broke. 
 Money makes so many things in life easier, but it can’t buy you a positive outlook on life. Fortunately, how any of us approaches each of our days is completely up to us. It’s not something you can buy or sell. It’s not hard to put a smile on your face every day, but for some reason some people find it impossible to do. Not me.
The opportunity to do something unique that makes me smile is something I try not to pass up, Dancing with the Stars is just that.
It’s not about how well I can dance. Its about the opportunity to compete at something I enjoy. Its about doing something that makes me smile every minute I’m doing it or even thinking about it.
Why am I competing on Dancing with the Stars ? Because its an opportunity to have a blast. Its a blast practicing. 2,3, 4 or more hours just blaze by is if its just minutes. Its hysterical what they are going to make me wear. Yesterday I felt like they had found Ricky Ricardos garage sale and bought up his clothes just for me. I’m going to be out there to win, but I promise you no one is going to be having a better time than me. I can promise you that.
When I’m 90 years old and talking to my grand kids and hopefully great grand kids, I won’t be the grandparent who tells them about the things I wished I had done and how they should experience life, I will be the grandparent with tons of great stories that hopefully inspires them to live their lives to the fullest .
That’s why I’m doing Dancing with the Stars,
