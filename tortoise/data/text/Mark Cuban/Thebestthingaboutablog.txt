  …is that I get to respond to the media.


  This is the email I got today from a columnist at the Dallas Morning News:

Here is my response to him:
This is what he wrote. Note that he conveniently used only part of my response to make it seem likemy comments
to Josh werein response to Bruce Bowen and Michael Finley getting into it. Unfortunately, he ignored the part of
my response that said it was not. My conversation with Josh was long before Fin and Bowen got into it.
And of course, this intrepid columnist completely ignored and left out the entire reason I was talking to Josh so he
could come in with a slam about why I shouldn’t be talking to players. How convenient for him.
From the Dallas Morning News’ Kevin Blackistone:
The sad part of all of this is that despite his disregard for the facts, Blackistone is one of the better
columnists.
That speaks volumes about his profession.
