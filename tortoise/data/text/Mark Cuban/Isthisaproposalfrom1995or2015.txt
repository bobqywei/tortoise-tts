I had reason to do some research and find some old goodies from the beginning of the world of streaming. This was first written in 1995 with testimonial emails added over time.
Since 2015 marks the 20th Anniversary year of streaming, i thought it would be fun for you to see that our proposals from back then aren‚Äôt a whole lot different from what we see in proposals today. The technology has improved. The market has changed. The proposition. Not so much. ¬†Ok maybe I had to explain what the Internet is and that‚Äôs not necessary today. But why nitpick üôÇ
Notice towards the end the offer of pre stream ads. Tags. Inserted commercials and more.
Who is AudioNet ?
AudioNet is the worlds first and largest Broadcast Network on the Internet, that‚Äôs who. We are just like your local cable company. The cable company licenses programming from about 100 different sources and offers a choice of about 50 to 75 television channels to its local trade market, or in some cases they will share content among several markets.. AudioNet licenses audio programming from hundreds of sources, and makes it available to the ENTIRE WORLD ! Better yet, unlike radio and television, we offer programming on demand. If you miss your favorite program during the day, you can listen to it on AudioNet that night ! With AudioNet, no one ever has to miss their favorite program or show !
AudioNet is one of the most popular destinations on the Internet. People around the world know that when they want their choice of LIVE and on demand audio programming there is only place to go, WWW.Audionet.Com, the worlds first Broadcast Network on the Internet !
AudioNet offers live broadcasts of radio stations such as KLIF Dallas, WTEM Washington DC, WMVP Chicago, KFI Los Angeles, KDGE Dallas, XTRA San Diego, WQAM Miami, WOR New York, WBAL Baltimore, KDGE Dallas, KZPS Dallas,WAMC New York, with many more to come. Then there are the LIVE broadcasts of exciting sporting events such as football and men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs basketball from more than 50 schools including, Texas A&M, University of Southern California, Michigan State, Nebraska, Baylor, North Carolina, Duke, and Florida. Plus, a growing schedule of professional football, baseball, basketball, lacrosse, hockey, and Indoor Soccer.

That‚Äôs right, AudioNet offers our users their choice of the programming they want and love, and its only on AudioNet!
What is the Internet ?
Everybody has used the phone system. Pick up the phone, dial a number, talk to a friend or business associate. What we don‚Äôt think about when we pick up the phone is what actually happens at the phone company.
When you dial a phone number, the phone company takes that number, and using their complex internetwork of computers, switches, and lots of fancy technology, they connect your phone to your friends‚Äô phone.
So what is the Internet ? The Internet is the phone system, but instead of all of those fancy computers at the phone company being used to connect phones for people to talk on, they connect computers so that they can talk to each other. Its real simple. The Internet is just a bunch of computers that have the ability to hold a conversation with each other.
People talk to each other and communicate using words. Computers talk to each using text, pictures, audio and in some cases video. That is what makes the Internet so special. When you connect your computer to the Internet you have access to millions and billions of words, pictures and sounds that you might not be able to find otherwise. Just as importantly, anybody who uses the Internet has access to whatever words, pictures or sounds you would like to make available to them !
So what does it take to ‚ÄúGet On the Internet ?‚Äù Its simple. All you need is a multimedia computer, a modem, and a connection to an Internet Service Provider.
An Internet Service Provider is someone who has gone to the phone company and told them that they want to specialize in allowing computers to connect to other computers. So they cut a deal that allows them to share high speed connections to other computers among all the people‚Äôs computers that they provide Internet Services to. This is not much different than Sprint and MCI, who bought tons of phone time from AT&T and turned around an specialized in selling long distance. Internet Service Providers specialize in selling computer access to the Internet.
To sign up for a connection to an Internet Service Provider usually only takes a single phone call to the Internet Service Provider, or AS AN AUDIONET CUSTOMER OR CONTENT PARTNER, we will do all of this for you !
What else do you need ? The only other thing you need is software known as Browser Software. This software, which we provide to you allows your computer to easily navigate all of the different computers on the Internet and display all of the sights, sounds and information available from the millions of computers connected to the net.
So what exactly is on the Net and why is everybody so excited ? Everything is on the net. That‚Äôs right, everything. There is not a single subject that isn‚Äôt covered. Want information on the Mona Lisa, do a search on the Mona Lisa, or Art, or Leonardo Da Vinci . Want to know the score of Army vs USC in 1973, no sweat its there. Want to review the latest fashions from Milan, its there. Want to know who is hiring in your field ? Demographics of skateboards in Delaware ?You can even find the menus of some of your favorite restaurants. Everyday more is being added. Experts are saying that the Internet will double in size in less than a year ! There is little question that when anyone wants personal or business information, the Internet will be the first place they start to look. The only question is whether they will find information about your business when they start to look, or will they find information about your competition !
AudioNet and the Future
The only constant with technology is change. Each and everyday technology advances to allow new things that no one ever dreamed of to be done. For AudioNet, technological change is opportunity for our customers and listeners. You see, AudioNet is technology independent. We will always be able to chose the technology that best serves our users. We will use other‚Äôs technology, and combine it with our own.

Today AudioNet is an Audio only network. We expect the bandwidth available to the home to increase dramatically over the next 2 to 4 years . We expect to be able to expand our offerings to include not only video, but also other new media images and formats, some of which are just now being invented !
What makes AudioNet special, is not only our technological independence and experience, but also our commitment to our customers and users. We will take your suggestions, and comments and use them to continuously upgrade the level of entertainment that we offer. We expect to have customized versions of AudioNet, so that the way you use AudioNet, is unique to you !
In terms of our breadth of reach, AudioNet currently serves more than 750,000 listeners per month. We expect that number to grow exponentially to more than 5,000,000 listeners per month, in LESS THAN 12 MONTHS. In fact, we expect that within 18 months, we will be the equivalent of the largest radio station in world !

The AudioNet JukeBox
The world it is a changing. Today, the computer is a normal appliance in the life of almost every student throughout the Western World. Along with the computer, comes access to the Internet. Today‚Äôs kids and young adults use the Internet almost as much as they watch today. In fact, the trend towards Internet usage is increasing, while the use of television among the young is decreasing. More importantly, internet users have a higher disposable income than television viewers. The question is, how do you most effectively reach this profitable audience. Enter the AudioNet JukeBox.
AudioNet, through its licenses with ASCAP and BMI, has created a JukeBox on AudioNet that offers users the chance to listen to their choice of more than 300 Cds, in their entirety. Although the JukeBox has been up and running only a matter of weeks, the response has been phenomenal.
Each day, more than 10,000 AudioNet users visit the JukeBox. With more than 8,000 choosing to listen to the CD of their choice. Plus, the base of JukeBox listeners is growing at more than 15% per week, with no slowdown in sight !
Our good fortune is your phenomenal opportunity. AudioNet is creating the opportunity for Music Companies, Distributors and Retailers to highlight their products through our AudioNet Pick of the Week.
The AudioNet Pick of the Week is a highlighted CD selection that is the first thing that JukeBox users see. As the Pick of the Week, your product will be seen by more than 10,000 potential customers each day.
Having so many potential listeners is a good thing, but the real question is, how many people will actually listen to the Pick of the Week ? Since our inception of the AudioNet JukeBox and the Pick of the Week, no CD has been listend to less than 400 times in a single day ! In fact the average is more than 500 per day ! Thats more than 3,500 people listening to your product each week !
In addition to your product being viewed and listened to by thousands each week, the AudioNet JukeBox Pick of the Week will contain a link back to your home page, or to a page we create, with information on how to purchase your product, whether from the closest retailer, or from a 1-800 number that you provide.
How To Participate in the AudioNet JukeBox
You will need to provide
Camera Ready Artwork for the Product to be highlighted
2 Copies of the CD to be highlighted
Either a link to a URL providing ordering information, or the layout for a page that will be hosted on Audionet

Long time listener, never time caller and ecstatic Audionet patron. I have
recently moved from Arlington to Tyler and could not receive the KLIF
signal inside my new place of employment. So simulcasting KLIF on the
Internet has filled my work time talk radio fix. I have been listening to
KLIF for seven years and watched KLIF grow and evolve into the
excellent station that it is today. The addition of the Internet service
proves that KLIF will remain on the cutting edge of the industry.

One of my buddies from Oklahoma rushed over to my office when he heard
that the OU game was going to be on. We gathered around the audiovision Mac
monitor and had a great time listening to the play by play. The feed dropped
out a couple of times, but the audio quality was excellent and you guys have
done a nice job on the interface.
My question to you.
Are you willing to rent out your expertise to get other people in different
parts of the country on line? I don‚Äôt know why Cal and Stanford aren‚Äôt on
line, but they should be, and some of our local talk radio shows are big time
