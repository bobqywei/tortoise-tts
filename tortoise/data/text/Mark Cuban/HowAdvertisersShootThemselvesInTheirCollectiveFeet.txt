The biggest challenge for advertisers today is to get people to watch their commercials. With all the technology and alternatives to watching commercials on TV I would think that advertisers would do everything humanly possible to eliminate any elements that would immediately trigger a viewer to fast forward to change the channel.
Is this not commen senese ?
If it is, then why in the world  do advertisers 
JACK UP THE VOLUME OF THEIR COMMERCIALS ? 
This annoying “feature” is more pronounced in home theater and surround sound  based systems. I  can’t think of anything that pisses me off more than to be watching a TV show and to all of the sudden be blasted by a commercial from all sides of the room. Its the ultimate command to change the channel or fast forward.
SO WHY ARE ADVERTISERS SO STUPID ? Turn down the sound, maybe people will lean forward and listen !
