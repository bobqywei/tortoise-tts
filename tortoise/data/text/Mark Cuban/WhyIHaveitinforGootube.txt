Its something that I get asked all the time. Why all the Youtube “hate”.
I don’t hate Youtube or Google. Have met them all, and think they are nice guys. What I have always had a huge dislike for is the 800 pound gorilla in any industry hiding behind the law and/or breaking the law to get what they want.
 As long as Google doesn’t have the confidence that  Google Video or Youtube  can survive without their users illegally uploading stolen videos and uses their financial muscle to try to  shoehorn itself into legal nook and crannies in order to try to dominate any space on the net, I’m going to point out every step that I believe is a misstep. Its the same way I have always felt about the RIAA. 
I’m against Piracy and have always felt that there were many  ways to fight it. Our day and date strategy in the movie business is a prime example  The RIAA has always taken the route of intimidation. It has used its financial muscle to go after individuals  they know can’t fight them. They used the law  to put entrepreneurs out of business and scare kids, parents and even grandparents. Their approach goes beyond just trying to protect music, it has a chilling effect on many other areas of our economy.  It is just wrong.
  Google is doing the exact same thing. They aren’t suing individuals and trying to collect money from them. Instead they are pushing the cost of doing business legally on copyright owners, 99pct of whom are tiny and can’t afford to protect themselves. Google could be a good corporate citizen and make sure they have permission from the copyright owner before a video is posted. Instead they have become the bully on the block.  They feel they have the legal right to tell every person who makes a living based on their creative efforts that they have to do business the Gootube way and if you don’t like it, sue us. Thats wrong today. It will be wrong tomorrow and its not something I will ever just accept.
