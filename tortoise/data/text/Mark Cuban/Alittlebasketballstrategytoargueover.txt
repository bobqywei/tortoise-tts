.5 seconds on the clock. Mavs up 81 to 80. Darrell Armstrong at the foul line to shoot 2. He makes the first.
Does he try to make the 2nd free thro or intentionally miss it ?
Thank goodness Im not the coach. I would have missed the 2nd shot, hoping the scramble for the rebound eats up the remaining half a second.
After the game, Avery Johnson explained why he wanted DA to make the 2nd free throw
If you miss and it’s a simple rebound, the clock doesn’t start till its touched.They would have told the refs they wanted an immediate time out on the rebound before the shot. So little time comes off the clock.
So they would probably have .4 left on the clock (If its lower, the refs probably reset it to .5).With a 20sec timeout remaining, they would have taken it and gotten the ball past half court.
If he makes the 2nd free throw, they take the same 20 sec timeout, and get the ball past half court
