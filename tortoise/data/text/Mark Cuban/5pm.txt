I dont know if i will update this regularly. I dont know if this will be the last post till ??
  I have a pregame ritual which includes working at my PC in my arena office. All the usual.
  Right now. Im dying. It feels like a vitamin rush. You know. The too many redbulls. Too many “lose weight now” and other assorted energy vitamins feel. The feeling of “im going to burst if we dont get going soon “.
  The good news is I have a smile on my face that no one will be able to wipe off for at least another 3 hours and 20 minutes.
  I plan on writing this. Checking somethings and getting on the court to shoot a couple baskets. I have to shoot some baskets on the NBA Finals floor. Period end of story. I wouldnt forgive myself if i didnt.
  Yeah, people will be around watching, which doesnt happen during the regular season, but so what. Yeah someone will accuse me of something . So what.
  I get to walk on the floor of the NBA finals and just throw some up.
  I dont care who you are. Thats pretty damn cool
