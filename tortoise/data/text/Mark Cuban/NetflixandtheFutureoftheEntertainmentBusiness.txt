I’m a big fan of Reed Hastings. Not just of his vision, but his honesty as well.   Reed posted his strategy deck on Slideshare.com . While we agree and disagree on a few items here and there, he does a great job identifying the risks created by Cable/satellite/telco (CST) .  The key quote on this slide ( page 26) –  “almost no customers leave cable for netflix”
Reed is one of the smartest guys in the space. This is a must read for anyone interested in the future of the entertainment business.
