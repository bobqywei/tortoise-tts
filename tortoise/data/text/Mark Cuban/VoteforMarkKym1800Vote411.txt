You didnt really think i would miss out on the chance to pump up the votes for Kym and I did you ? 
I’m up against all the pretty boys , athletes and entertainers tonight, but the vote counts for 50 pct of our total, so jump on board and vote for us !!
Am I nervous, absolutely. My knees aren’t shaking, yet, but im guessing they may be come gametime.
As far as a hint for tonight, all i can tell you is that I couldn’t get the lawnmower or sprinkler in tonights routine, but I did get “churn the butter” in. So when you see me pull it out, dont laugh too hard :). And since Jane Seymour is on the show (she is amazing), I promised I would try to get the Motorboat in a future routine as a tribute to her making it famous in The Wedding Crashers.
As you can probably tell, I’m having a blast with all of this.  I can promise everyone that no one is having more fun than Kym and I. That Im going to be the guy with a big smile on his face, singing and dancing my way through tonight’s show.
Tonight is important in many ways. Not only for my dancing future, but….
Hopefully, tonight will lead the way so that future generations of guys can walk into any wedding reception or nightclub knowing that Churn the Butter and in the future , the Sprinkler, Lawnmower and the Motorboat can bring joy and happiness to your wives and girlfriends.  That they will finally be accepted as a proper dance routines they are. Maybe we can see Ballroom competitions for traditional guy dances ? “Now dancing the Sprinkler…”
Voting for Mark and Kym tonight and hopefully on future nights will be one small step towards bringing couples out of their chairs and on to the dancefloors where man and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend and any combination there of, can proudly do the dances that we guys excel at.
If you have made it this far.. thanks and Vote for Mark and Kym early and often and ask your friends to do the same ! hopefully you will have as good a time watching as I will be dancing
