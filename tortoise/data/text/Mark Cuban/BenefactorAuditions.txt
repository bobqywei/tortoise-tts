Ok, the ball is rolling everyone. Auditions start this week! I will be at the Dallas, Atlanta and Las Vegas auditions. I can’t wait to see what people come up with.
The promo ads started running last night on ABC, and the tapes that have come in have been great. Regular people doing stuff that is amazing, funny, wierd, interesting, a little bit of everything. It’s going to be tough to narrow to the first sixteen, but it will be fun!
If you can’t make the auditions, no worries, put together a tape. The tape will get watched!
I would love to hear any feedback from those who went to the auditions, or if you saw the commercial on ABC.
