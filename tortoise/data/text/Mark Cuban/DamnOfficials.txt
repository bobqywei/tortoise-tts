You would think the officials in miami would be able to get something so simple right. Wouldnt you ? How difficult is it to see what is or isnt right in front you ?
It amazes me that Miami Officials are telling everyone that they made me take down a Go Mavs Go banner from my boat parked out side the American Airlines Arena.
Well guess what guys.
I dont own a boat.
Never have. Never will. I rented one once. Rowed one a couple times. Thats it.
My apologies to the real owner of that boat who is getting pestered with helicopters and people trying to corner them.
and on the topic of the game last night. No more emails about losing the 4 seconds with 48 seconds to go. THe league knows the game clock was not stopped and 4 secs ran off the clock incorrectly. So all of you Tivo users that emailedme are correct.
They are looking at it to make sure it doesnt happen again.
