Right now the Grizz and the Clippers are battling it out for the 5th playoff spot. The Nuggets pretty much have their division locked up. Locking in the 3rd seed.
The 5th seed plays the 4th seed. The 3rd seed plays the 6th seed. The interesting tidbit however is that between the 3rd and 6th seed, the team with the better record gets home court advantage.
So riddle me this NBA fans.
What happens if both the Grizz and Clips clinch homecourt advantage over the Nuggets ?. Put another way, its possible that, and Im just picking numbers here, the Grizz and Clips are tied with 4 games to play, andboth teams know that the team that loses more of those 4 games gets home court advantage against the Nuggets.The team that wins more, getsthe Mavs or Spurs starting on the road.
Isnt the goal of the whole season to gain homecourt advantage for as many playoffseries as possible ?
How much fun would it be to see the teams trying to lose games ? Or more to the point, lying about trying to win games, but “resting” their players.
Remember, homecourt isnt just about having a better chance to win with your fans behind you. Its an opportunity for teams to make more money.
If this isnt a reason to change the playoff series seeding right now, i dont know what is.
