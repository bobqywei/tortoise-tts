If you develop Social Games I want to talk to you. Im looking to invest in  games,  developers and projects
Im looking for consumer and corporate applications. I’m not looking for knockoffs of existing games/apps. I’m also looking for physical products that have integrated social gaming components . My preference for all the above is that they run on or  integrate deeply  with Facebook and/or Itunes 10/Ping and all the devices they support.
You can post them here or email me at blogmaverick@aol.com.
If I like it , I will respond. If I dont, I wont.  I wont sign and NDA.
TIA
