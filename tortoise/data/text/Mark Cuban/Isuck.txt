It was a long night for me. I guess I have to apologize to all Mavs fans for last night’s game. I took the Hawks too lightly. I thought I could prove to myself that superstitions are ridiculous. I thought of any game, this was the game where I didn’t have to wear the right shirt. I didn’t have to stop at 7-Eleven and get my two sugar-free Red Bulls and Diet Mountain Dew.
I tried to right the wrong at halftime when we were way down by changing shirts. It wasn’t enough.
It was a tough lesson, but I learned once again to never underestimate an NBA opponent.
To switch topics for those who asked, the movie Todd Wagner and I produced, Godsend, with Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Greg Kinnear and Robert De Niro, is set to premiere on April 30th.
Over the next few weeks I will share some of the stories  yes she is that hot  and some of the hassles due to the subject matter.
