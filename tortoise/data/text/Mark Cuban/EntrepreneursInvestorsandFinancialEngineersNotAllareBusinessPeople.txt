The most interesting aspect of the debate last night was with the President referring to Gov Romney as an investor while Gov Romney referred to himself as a businessman. It’s a distinction with a huge difference.
It made me think back to a post I wrote almost exactly 4 years ago, prior to the last election. We need entrepreneurs. We need Investors. There is definitely a place in the market for “spreadsheet capitalists” Just as short sellers can help us identify poor companies or poor company habits, SpreadSheet Capitalists make us realize just where our system is wrong and needs to be changed, but we have to also recognize the parts of the system they will exploit and the HUGE problems they will cause to our economy if not proactively considered. With the multiple bubbles and collapses of the last 20 years my hope is that we will have learned some lessons. We can’t do the same things over and over and expect different results. LIke everyone else I want to see more people go back to work. In fact, I’m investing in companies as fast as I can to help add to the economy and create jobs. But we can’t let our desperation to create jobs blind us from the exact problems that put our economy in this position.
