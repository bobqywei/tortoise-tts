Just got done working out. Did my interviews from the Gauntlet. Probably kind of rude of me not to change my schedule to fit all the media and guests who have come to see the NBA 2.0 .
  I just didnt want to bust my routine. So its a sweaty handshake to the Commissioner. Which actually shows how cool he can be. Its an ESPN interview with Stuart Scott. Anything to take my mind off of sweating like a pig and breathing hard. Its some stupid questions from a Miami TV Station.. ‚ÄúAre you excited ?‚Äù.. that type of thing. Preperation is key . Huh üôÇ
  Oh, for those who care. I couldnt hit a shot. I got some rythm going, but i basically choked. No bragging rights for me.
  Time to clean up. Get it done. The guys just did their count down in the hall and ran on the court. Thats my cue to roll on !
  GO MAVS !!!
