We have developed and enhanced a player and lineup evaluation system. We have been working on this for the last 8 years. Its far from perfect, and its greatest value is that over a period of years we have been able to identify trends to help us identify up and coming, starring and declining players. It also helps us understand what combinations  of players work well together, and which dont. 
To give you a basic understanding of the system, at its most basic its a plus minus system. Then we adjust it to take into account who the opponent is, is it home or away, are you playing against the other teams good lineup or bad lineup, what the score and game clock are (scoring the game winner is worth more than the 1st basket of the game. Scoring when up by 30 is worth nothing). If the team scores or gets a stop when the game is on the line, then your impact percentage goes up. We reward for getting the job done when it matters.
We track as you can see below by last games, and also track the variance. In other words, average  is pretty much meaningless. You can score plus 20 one day, zero the next, but are you a 10 level
player ? We track the variance of the players performance. THe lower the variance, the more consistent the player on offense or defense.
One more point, these numbers don’t reflect necessarily the best players in the league, but what they do reflect is the players that are being best put in a position to succeed and are delivering.
When their teams have a need, they deliver. Thats why some names are not the biggest names. its also a reflection of their coaches. Some coaches don’t necessarily use their players in the
best lineups or matchups, which negatively impacts their ability to perform. Others are consistently good at it.
