Still waiting to hear from the Nuggets PR people. I appreciate all the suggestions for wonderful charities that people have posted in response to my last blog. However, in the event I dont hear back from the Nuggets, Im going to give the money to the  Players Association Goals and Dreams Fund in the names of Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore.
Why in their names ? As a reminder of what could have happened, and that not every retaliation attempt misses.  Tragedy can be one swing or one elbow away. There is no place for any action that could end someone’s career or worse, in any sport
