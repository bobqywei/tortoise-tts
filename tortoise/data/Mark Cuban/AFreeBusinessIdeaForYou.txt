I was in NY for most of the week.  Everytime I walked past a newstand or street vendor it disturbed me to no end that they wore their own clothing. In particularly , their own T-Shirts. Why ?
Because it made absolutely no sense to me that some entrepreneur had not done a deal that required the employees of these businesses to wear branded T Shirts.
Dexter was everywhere in NY promoting the premiere of the show. Except on these T Shirts.  How much would a hot dog vendor charge to wear a Dexter T Shirt ? A T Shirt promoting any product or brand ?
Would some smart person PLEASE find out if there are any ownership groups of street vendors and newstands and work out a deal with them ?
Unless there is some law I dont know about, there must be  a shot for someone to make some good money in major cities. Please do it so I feel better.
