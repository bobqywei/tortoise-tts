As inevitable as the Mitchell Report response was, how long will it be before we get the headline:
“Popeye denies he knew spinach was a performance enhancing drug”.
“I had no idea. I was just eating my vegetables. It was supposed to make me stronger. It was what, 30 or more years ago ? How much did we really know about the properties of spinach back then ? Why is the media making such a big deal out of this ? I didn’t know then and I am paying the price today. Divorce. Family loss. Boomerang dropped the show because of all the fuss you guys are making. My last source of real income, gone.”
 Leading into the inevitable interviews with Brutus saying that he knew something was up but pressure from the Network kept him from speaking up. So he took his beatings. All of which eventually led to weekly, then daily therapy sessions and his current addiction to anti-depressents.
Olive Oil will refuse all informal interviews, but we will be able to dissect some of her problems she attributed to Popeye’s mood swings and spinach habit from TMZ.Com interviews as she shops for her Depends at Greenbergs Pharmacy near her apartment in Burbank.
And Sweat Pea ? He has disappeared. Not seen since his stint on a VH1  reality show a couple years ago.
Our society loves gossip and the media loves to report it. What the sports media has to understand is the difference between reporting gossip and reporting news. I’m not saying that the Mitchell Report shouldnt be reported and commented on. It should. For a couple days. Then it should be relegated to industry trade press and gossip pages. Sports fans want sports.
Its ok to mention and report about  popeye being in the spinach report, but don’t beat it to death. Tell us about baseball
