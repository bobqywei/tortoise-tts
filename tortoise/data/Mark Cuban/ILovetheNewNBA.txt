No complaining. No backtalk. No taking off your warmups on the court. No arena sound system is too loud. The new ball. All changes for the better. Anyone who has seen me at the games knows its a completely different ballgame, and Im thankful. 
I’m excited to get feedback from the fans as well. I would love to read everyone’s comments on how they feel about the changes since I’m sure they wlll be positive. So please, take the time to let me know !
