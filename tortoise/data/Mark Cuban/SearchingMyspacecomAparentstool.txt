My daughter is only 2 1/2. Not old enough, yet, to have a myspace page. Not quite anyway. But I have some friends with kids who are right at the age where they are concerned.
They want to be able to find out if they are on there, if they are being talked about, if they are referred to in any way, or if their friends, schools or associates are.
Its always been possible to use search engines to search myspace.com or any URL using the site: command on Google or Icerocket.com, but few parents are search engine literate enough to know how to do so. I know RTFM has taken on awhole new meaning these days, but very fewread or try to understand the advanced features of search engines. Its the milleniums equivalent of the blinking 12:00 on VCRs. The advanced link stares you in the face all the time, but its just ignored.
To help them out, icerocket.com has added a Myspace tab. Any search defaults to myspace.com and you can search for anything and everything. Its fast. Its easy. Its not infallible. Its not a replacement for keeping an eye out for what your kids are doing when they surf the net, but it might make you as a parent feel a little more comfortable and arm you with a tool that can only help.
I suggest you check it out.
