I read a ton. Online, magazines, newspapers. I troll the newsstands for new magazines just trying to see if there is something out there Im missing.
I also get asked all the time what magazines that I do read. I’m not going to go through the list, but I’m going to list two that are must reading for anyone who has an interest in technology. Why ? Because they often cover in technical detail just how 99pct of the bandwidth available to the home is managed, planned and maintained.
It’s amazing to me how all the “internet pundits” truly have no understanding that 98pct of the bandwidth to most people’s homes is not allocated to the internet, its allocated to everything else digital and analog and managed quite differently than the internet bandwidth that you receive. Not understanding the difference between the two (internet and non) pretty much eliminates your ability to understand the future of broadband technology to the home.
To help the uninformed, I decided to share my 2 faves:Communications Technology
ScreenPlays 
These are the 2 magazines that I save every issue of and that I get excited to learn something new.
