Ok, maybe not ever. Certainly not the most important thing ever, not even close. But i have to tell you, one thing that has driven me crazy this summer. One thing that has taken far more time than I should have spent on it.
That one thing..
Finding a replacement to RockNRoll Part 2 by Gary Glitter to play at the Mavs games. You know the song. The hey song. The song that everyone in sports stole from the NHL, who stole it from who knows who.
This isnt a cure for world peace issue. But its one of those things that drive me crazy.
Not that there is anything wrong with the song. We will definitely keep on playing it.
And its not like we arent trying to be original. We have done parodies of songs, some unique, some not, and we will do more. Some we will just play, most will have animations so the fans can have fun with them.
But the problem remains. Maybe the blogosphere can help.
I need at least one song that is simple, has few or no words, is short and will automatically cause 20k people to stand, clap and shout in unison.
Any suggestions ?
Back to figuring out what to wear for our first Mavs game. Its TNT and I have to come up with something good ðŸ™‚
