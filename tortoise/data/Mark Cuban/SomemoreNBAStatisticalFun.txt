I’m working with some very smart people who are doing some very helpful and smart things. One question that they answered that I had was…What is the difference in shooting percentage by player, team and league between the longer 3 point shot vs the shorter corner 3 point shot.
I’m not going to give up the goods on the Mavs, but feel free to send this information to your favorite team…
As a league, through Jan 27th, we shoot about 37.6 pct from the short corner vs 33.6 pct vs the long.
All but 3 teams shoot better from the short than the long, those 3 are Atlanta, Detroit, Miami. Detroit has the biggest variance, shooting 35.3 pct from the long and 30.9 pct from short.
Houston , Philly and The Spurs have the biggest variance the otherway. Each shoots at least 8 percentage points better from the corner.
The Sonics shoot the best in the NBA from the corner, 42.7pct. Given thats an effective fieldgoal percentage of 64 pct, it’s no wonder they are near the top in corner 3 attempts. They have better results from the corner than they do shots closer than 5 feet!
The Spurs take the greatest percentage of their 3 pointers from the corner. 56.7 pct of their 3s are corner bound and they hit 40 pct of them for an effective field goal rate of 60 pct ! Given they shoot 8 points better from the corner, and their effective field goal rate is higher from the corner than anywhere else on the court other than 5 feet and in, could this be the key to the Spurs offense?
The only team in fact that takes more corner 3 point shots than the Spurs, is the Suns. They have taken 534 to the Spurs 501. The Suns have hit 41.1%, for an effective FG rate of 61.7% Maybe they have figured out something the rest of us havent. Or maybe now that we know, this is a way to slow down both offenses.
On the flipside, the Clips have taken the fewest corner shots..135.
In terms of players, Bruce Bowen has attempted the most corner 3s in the NBA, 137 of them, hitting 37.9 percent for an effective FG pct of 57%.
Joe Johnson has made the most from the corner. He has hit 51 pct of his 112 attempts for an Effective FG (EFF FG) pct of 77.68 %! Cutino Mobley and Mike Miller both have EFF FG of greater than 80 pct from the corner. But they all pale compared to the Mayor in Minny. Freddy Hoiberg has taken 31 corner 3s, and hit 21 of them. Thats an EFF FG of greater than 100 pct ! Shaq for a dunk or the Mayor from the corner… The Mayor gets you more!
In the 70 pct or greater EFF FG Pct category add Battier, Jimmy Jackson, Beano Udrich and Kyle Korver. In the 60 pct or greater EFF FG add JRich, Ray Allen, TMac, Wally, DStoudamire, Ginobli and Barry from the Spurs, Tinsley, Lewis and Radmonovic from the Sonics, Redd, Marshall, Murray and Rose from the Raps, Arenas and Jeff Mcinnis, Gordon from Chi, and more.
Guys who can’t hit the shot, but take it. Rasheed Wallace is 4 for 31, Antoine Walker is is 14 for 71, Doug Christie is 4 for 24, Troy Hudson is 6 for 28 In terms of short 3 pct vs long 3 percentage (reg pct, not EFF pct). Antonio Daniels drops of 26 pct, Joe Johnson shoots 40 pct from straight away, Beano Udrich drops off 25 pct, Willie Green drops off 31 pct, Korver drops 15 pct, Shane 15pct, Jimmy Jackson 21 pct, JRich 22 pct, TMac 14 pct, Ray Allen 9 pct, BRuss 18pct, Tayshan Prince 22 pct, Raja Bell 18 pct, Wally 12 pct. That’s from a quick look down the list. There are some guys that shoot better from the long 3. Reggie Miller shoots 10 pct better, Chauncy Billups 13pct, same with Allan Houston, Rasheed Walker and Antoine Walker who each shoot 15 pct or more better from straight away One last fun fact. There are more than 100 players who have an effective FG rate of 50 pct or better from the corner…
What does it all mean? You decide.
