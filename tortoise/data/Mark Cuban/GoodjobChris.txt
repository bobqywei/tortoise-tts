I dont know if he will make the cut, but I have to say I LOVE people who do something. Chris McKeever, I tip my hat to you. Most people come up with creative ways to ask, you came up with creative action that leveraged pretty much everything Ihave an interest in.
The casting process for The Benefactor show has a specific process, so I cant do anything to give you an edge, but I can give you props. Good job Chris.
