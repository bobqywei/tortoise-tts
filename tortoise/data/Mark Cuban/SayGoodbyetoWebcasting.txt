Friday was a sad day , no, make that a shocking day in the webcasting community. On Friday, the Copyright Royalty Board finalized the webcasting royalty rate based on a cost per play, with a 500 dollar minimum per channel , while also completely eliminating any percentage of revenue options. In a nutshell it was the day the internet music died.
Rather than going through the entire obituary, I will defer to KurtHansons wonderful RAIN site for all the gory details.
I remember setting up servers from progressive networks and xing to stream AudioNets first station, KLIF in 1995. I remember creating Christmas stations, Elvis stations and letting people program their own internet radio station. Then as with now, the vast majority of streaming took place during the day in the office. 
Everything that is happening with video now, happened first with audio. Below isnt pretty, but its a reminder of where we started .
