I stand by everything i said in my last blog.
Actually you guys proved my point.
Did you read the blog at all ? It was nice that TNT left out the reference to us tracking our results on defense and going to and away from what was working or not.
CB, get a 2 way with internet access. There is some good info out there that could make you better at what you do. More importantly, when you say people out there that spend their days on computers have no life.. time to step into 2005. When you said that , TNT and the NBAs audience that advertisers covet the most looked at each other and laughed. THen they IMed or TXT messaged their buddy list and called you out again. Get that 2 way CB. It will make it easier to keep in touch with the family and to do your job. You will love it.
And comparing your basketball IQ to mine isnt quite apples to apples given that Im not the coach. Im willing to compare the basketball knowledge of AJ, Del Harris, Joe Prunty and Larry Riley to the two of you anytime. My guess, you guys are on the short end of the stick
Nothing personal guys, but working off generalizations of how the game was played when you played doesnt get it done. Our coaches know the game. They dont just coach on reputation, they coach the game and coach to improve the team forJune.
Of course all of this is only talk. It all comes down to our guys doingtheir jobs.Theydo whatever it takes to make our team better every day. They dont just show up and play because “they know how to play”. Hopefully it will win us a championship
No matter what your profession, if you arent busting ass to be prepared and to get better, you are falling behind. Im not sure the TNT guys understand that concept.
Its not personal, its just business advice.
