First, sorry for the delay in posting…It’s been a little crazy around here.
2nd, everyone knows as much asI do about all the trade rumours floating around. Believe it or not, even in the NBA discussions start based off of what we read in the newspapers. Making a trade happen is never simple. Teams want to make sure they have covered all their bases, and when you add in the expansion draft, and then the regular draft, it creates a lot of variables that need to be taken into account and that typically slows things. Not always…but usually. So my job is to try to explore all the options and then compare those to what Donnie is telling me is happening around the league. It all takes time,and never happens on the timetable you want or expect.
Third, I got to see the first pass of the Benefactor SizzleReel. This is the video that the production company puts together for advertisers and insiders to get a feel about the show. I nabbed a copy.. (sorry to the person whose desk I took it from…. you know who you are and I apologize….)
If you want to check it out, it’s a huge file at 70mbs, so give it some time to download…
