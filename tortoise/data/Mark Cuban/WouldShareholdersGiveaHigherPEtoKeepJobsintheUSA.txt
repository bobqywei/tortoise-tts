It used to be that if you owned shares of a public company, you actually felt like you owned shares of that company.  The concept of actual ownership by individuals is long gone.  Shareholders as owners are nothing but a concept , and echo from days gone by.
That shouldn’t be a surprise. It’s just as rare for individuals with less than 10 figures in their networth to even consider actually buying shares as a path to ownership.
But what if this were not the case any longer  ? For those of you that own shares of stocks in companies,either directly or indirectly, would you be willing to take a lower earnings per share, or on the flip side, hold your stock at a higher P/E Ratio if in exchange the company moved their manufacturing to the USA  ?
Would Apple shareholders be wiling to accept Apple moving jobs back and not sell when the announcement was made ? Name a company that you as a shareholder would be willing to hold, knowing that earnings would be lower, but jobs would come back to the USA ?
I don’t directly own shares of any companies that do manufacturing overseas (at least that i know of), so I haven’t had to consider this. I know in my own personal businesses I try not to squeeze every penny out. I just want to be profitable and earn a decent return, but I recognize that a good or decent return is not the maximum return.
I feel the same way about tax free accounts overseas. I don’t have any personal bank accounts in Switzerland. I own a house in the Cayman Islands, but I don’t have a bank account there and I wont put a bank account there. I’m pretty sure that one of the hedge funds I invested in has accounts there, but I’m not involved in its operations. So i don’t have a say.
What do you think ? Would you cut a public company slack if they brought back jobs to the USA ?
