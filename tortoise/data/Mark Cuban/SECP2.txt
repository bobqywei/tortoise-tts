On behalf of
Mark Cuban
RE: SEC Civil Action in the United States District
for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division
The SEC knows their case centers on one telephone conversation between two individuals- 4 years ago. The SEC claims there was an agreement between these parties to the conversation to keep certain information confidential. We interviewed Guy Faure, the former CEO of Mamma.com Inc., with whom the SEC claims Mr. Cuban made an agreement. We had a court reporter transcribe the interview. There was no agreement to keep information confidential. Here is a relevant excerpt from the interview with Mr. Faure:
CHRISTOPHER CLARK :
1) Q- We spoke earlier about you were telling Mr. Cuban in words or substance : “I have confidential information for you”.
A- Right.
2) Q- Do you recall anything Mr. Cuban said in response or reply to that statement by you ?
A- No, I do not.
The SEC knows this-they have the transcript, yet they brought the case anyway. Why? Do they have a different statement from Mr. Faure ?
Why did the SEC end their multi-year investigation of Mamma.com Inc. for alleged securities laws violations days before interviewing present and former Mamma.com Inc. executives about this matter? Was the timing a coincidence? We think not.
Any inquiries respecting this release should be directed to Stephen Best at Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP (202) 346-8735.
