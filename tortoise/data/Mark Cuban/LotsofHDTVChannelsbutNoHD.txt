There is nothing wrong with the new HDTV that you just spent a fortune on. 
It’s not yours’ or the TV’s fault that the picture quality you are seeing on your brand spanking new TV looks like crap compared to what you saw in the store. 
It’s not your fault that you signed up for and paid extra for the HD package from your video provider, got all excited about your favorite network and shows  finally being in HD and then looking worse than it did on your old TV. Its not your fault because what far too many TV networks are trying to pass off as HD isnt really HD. Its not even close. 
TV Networks are misleading consumers into thinking they are getting HD versions of their networks. Which leads to a simple question. What makes a TV Network HD ?If a network calls itself an HD Network, does that make it an HD Network ? Or should the network be required to actually have content that is of high definition resolution ? And if they have HD Resolution content, how much should they actually have before they can call themselves HD ? 
In the coming months cable, telco and satellite providers are gearing for a marketing battle over who has the most HD channels.  Ads will be everywhere touting big name networks finally bringing HD versions to the masses. 
 Unfortunately for consumers, the schedules of many, if not most of those new channels will have less than 10pct of their content actually  produced using HD cameras and shown at HD resolution.  Few will have more than 3 hours a day of HD resolution content.  
I think a lot of consumers are going to be very, very disappointed. 
When you turn the channel to an HD network that you are paying for, shouldn’t you have the right to expect to see content in full HD Resolution ? Of course. Unfortunately you won’t. For many “HD” networks, you may go DAYS without seeing any real HD content. 
That’s not right.
