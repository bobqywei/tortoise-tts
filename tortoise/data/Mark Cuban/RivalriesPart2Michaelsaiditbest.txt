Of all the emails I have gotten from spurs fans, this is the best. So i wanted to put it in a blog becausehe hits the nail on the head and says what I didnt think to put in thelast blog post.
Hey Mark, you are right about the rivalry. Spurs get absolutely no air  time because the nation finds them uninteresting. Yet, the Lakers can have  a non-playoff season and get almost every game televised.
  That said, I would have to say I dislike you. So, your plan is working. I  would never curse at anyone, especailly a pregnant women. But, I would  definitely heckle you. I even wrote on my rear windshield, “Mark Cuban  Sucks!”, with the ‘u’ a Spur. My wife told my that it was pointless for me  to do that because you are so rich that you wouldn’t care. But, you are  the enemy, and I will stop at nothing to voice my opinion.
Michael is absolutely right that Spurs game. A Mavs or Pistons game, is always going to be 2nd to whoever Kobe, Lebron or Shaq is playing in terms of national interest. We arent going to get airtime until the networks broadcast as many Lakers, Cavs or Heat games as they can.
So while you’re thinking hard about how to clean up that nasty, muddy water that runs inside the incredibly beautiful San Antonio Riverwalk that we all love to take strolls along (even if we are concerned we might get bumped and fall in) and spend lots of money at the restaurants and bars (particularly the locally owned establishments and not the national chains) and raise lots of tax dollars for the wonderful city of San Antonio, put aside a few brain cycles and tell me your ideas of how to make people across the country care enough about our teams and our rivalry to watch us play rather than watch the other shows on this monday night, and on future game days
It may not be important to anyone else to make this happen, but it is to me. So Im wide open to ideas. If you dont like my way, give me some better ideas !
