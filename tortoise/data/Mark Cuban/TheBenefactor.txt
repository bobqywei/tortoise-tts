I had no idea how crazy, how much fun and how intense it would be doing this show. I know I’m having fun when I get there about 8:30 in the morning, and when I realize I’m hungry and haven’t eaten, it’s past midnight!
We have an amazing, amazing cast of 16, split evenly between guys and girls. I wanted diversity and that’s exactly what I got. I’m not just talking demographics. We have nice people, and people who I thought would be nice and weren’t. There are fun people and serious people. We have Divas and Drama Queens. We have an Oprah wannabe, a professional football player, collegiate athletes, and two people who sing show tunes when under pressure.
The game is always on. The competition is always in play. I wanted this to be like the real world. If you want to make a million dollars, you’d better be ready to compete 24x7x365, and the game reflects that. The pressure is intense and continuous, and response of the contestants under pressure has been eye-opening.
Personally, the game is getting more and more difficult for me.I have really grown fond of most of the contestants. They are really cool people. Making the cuts is like firing a friend. It hurts. I have had to cut people several times already and it is not easy.
The good news side is that unless someone is completely scamming me, and it’s still possible, I am going to really enjoy giving the check for 1mm dollars to winner.
Stay tuned for more!
