I love when a partner of mine takes a bold stand and gets it right. Dan Rather over the past few days has taken on the broadcast news business and as he is given to do, pulled no punches and told it “Just the way it is”.
HDNet hired Dan Rather to create Dan Rather Reports this past November . Its a program that I’m incredibly proud of. Our subscribers, the  media and industry have responded to Dan Rather Reports with continuous praise.
If you havent seen it, here is a link to Dan’s interview on Fox News. Its well worth watching.
I’m a big believer in standing up for what you believe in. I’m proud to have Dan as a partner at HDNet.
For those who haven’t seen it, here is a sample :
