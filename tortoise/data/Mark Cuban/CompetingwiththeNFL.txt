is it crazy to try to compete with the NFL ? 
I donâ€™t think so. Here is why:
1. There is obviously demand for top level professional football. That is exactly what the UFL hopes to be someday, an equal of the NFL, if not more.
2. The NFL wants and needs competition. They have grown so big and powerful that every  move they make is scrutinized by local or federal officials. A competitor allows them to point to us and explain that their moves are for competitive reasons rather than the move of a monopoly.
3. They just extended their CBA.  Their CBA structure is not designed for a competitive environment.  Competition for top players, even if the UFL gets  just a few, increases prices at the top end for all teams. Every star will get paid more, but still have to fit under the cap. That forces teams to use more low cost players, at the expense of signing the middle of the roster. That gives us access to quite a few very, very good NFL players.  The downside is that it will significantly impact  small market NFL teams and  its unclear how the NFL would respond to that and what the impact would be on the UFL. 
4. There are a lot of markets that are bigger than some current NFL markets that do not have teams that would love to have a pro football team.
5. There are a lot of smart people involved in the UFL 
6. Its a great TV product. 
These are just my personal reasons for having an interest in being involved with the UFL.  They still have a ton of work to do before a game can be played. Like all good ideas with a great opportunity available to it, the hard part is in the execution.  
Hopefully they can get it done.
