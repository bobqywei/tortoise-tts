First props to Kobe for the two most amazing back-to-back, end-of-game/OT shots EVER.
I would have bet everything against him making those 2 shots back to back with no one guarding himunbelievable! Hello Sacramento. Just when I was getting ready for my Jack Nicholson conversation (Jack sits right next to the visiting team bench and is always an adventure).
Instead I get to visit my boys Joe and Gavin. Great, great guys, and we always want to play each otherjust not in the first round. Its a tough business, not everyone goes home a winner.
I digress. Back to Kobeâ€™s pass off the backboard. Many commented and emailed about how it was legal because it did hit the backboard. Wrong answer.
The correct answer, confirmed by Stu Jackson today, is that it should have been a travel because it was not a shot. No attempt was made to actually make a basket. Since it was not a field goal attempt, it was a pass, and you cant pass to yourself off the backboard.
