Unique opportunities. How many of them will you have in your life ? 1 ? None ? 100s ? The thing about life is that its impossible to know. You never know when something you never even considered could happen, will happen.
As something you has been incredibly blessed, let me just tell you that the things at the top of my list are not numbers or dollars.  They are my family and the things I had fun doing.
A lot of people think Im crazy, or chasing publicity, or whatever. I don’t care what they think. Before I do any of the many things that I get asked to do, and that I think might be fun, I have one simple question i ask myself.  When I hopefully turn 90 and look back at my life , would I regret having done it, or not having done it ?
Before I started Motley’s Pub with Evan Williams when we were at Indiana University and I wasnt even old enough to drink, it was the question i asked myself. Before we sold MicroSolutions. Before I spent the money to buy a Lifetime Pass on American Airlines when I was 29 and then retired to travel the word.  Before I bought the Mavs. Before I did The Benefactor on ABC, or Dancing with the Stars, or Survivor and RAW this coming monday nite, or any number of other fun and amazing things I have done. Its the question I asked myself. To me its part of being successful.
When Im 90, will I smile when i think back, or will I frown and regret not having done it.  IMHO,  Success is about making your life a special version of unique that fits who you are. Not what other people want you to be.
