Sometimes you got to brag. Tuesday nights on HDNet is News Night. We lead off with Dan Rather ReportsDan has brought back real news with a full 60 minutes of reporting on news that matters. If you haven’t yet, check out some of his reports that we are streaming online
DRR leads right into HDNet World Report.  World Report, which is produced by Dennis OBrien  doesn’t get the visibility that Dan Rather Reports gets, but it knocks out great stories from around the globe week after week.  Today, HDNet World Report finally started to get some of the recognition it deserved.  Today, at  the 74th annual National Headliner Awards, sponsored by The Press Club of Atlantic City, N.J. HDNet walked away with first place winners in TWO categories !
The first was for  Documentary or Series of Reports: HDNET, “The Forgotten Front: Terrorism in the Phillipines; beating out  CNN with their amazing  “CNN Presents: God’s Warriors;” and  CNN for their , “Children of the Storm.”Our 2nd win came for News Magazine Program: HDNet World Report, “Uganda’s Silent War ( a co production with Newshour with Jim Lehrer);”  finishing ahead of 2nd and 3rd place finishers, Dateline NBC, “To Catch a Con Man;” JumpStart Productions/NOW on PBS, “Casualties of War”.
You don’t have to be the biggest to beat the best, but you do have to outwork the bigger players. Congrats to everyone at HDNet and the entire World Report team for doing amazing work and  making us proud.
This is just the beginning and we promise the best is yet to come !
