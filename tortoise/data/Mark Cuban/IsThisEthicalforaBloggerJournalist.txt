A couple months ago I agreed to do an interview with a major national magazine that I enjoy and respect.  I rarely do face to face interviews because I have significant trust issues with how an interview can be reflected in a story. 
 I try to stick exclusively to email for all my interviews. In this case I made an exception because I had developed a good relationship with the magazine. 
The interview process was unexceptional. Meaning that it went well. The writer and I got along and I thought it was a fun interview to do.
The article came out last week and I liked it. No problems at all.
Then yesterday, the person who interviewed me, who is also a blogger, decided to blog about our interview. The blog ran on a site that he is associated with, but is not affiliated at all with the magazine the interview was for. He never asked, nor told me that our interview would be blogged about. While I respect the magazine, I am not a fan of the site he works for, or of its affiliated site that the blog ran on. A point I let him know. I would not have done the interview had I known he would blog about it for this site.
As it turns out, he did not clear the blog with the magazine either. 
So he traveled on their dime to do an interview for their magazine and then used the interview to generate a blog for his site from a subject that was not expecting to be blogged about.
Ethical or not ?
