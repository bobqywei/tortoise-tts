This was the article that was published in
  todays NY Times Business Section
  First, the headline.
“Mark Cuban Is Mad (Again). But Why?”
I didnt know i was mad about anything. I guess if the NY Times says I am, I must be. But rather than me guessing
  how they got from interview to headline and article, I will just let the interview speak for itself.
 Here you go!
So, there you have the email chain.
From all the above, it somehow got put together as this
article.
I responded to what I hoped would be an interesting discussion about the merits of a company based on a referral
  from someone I respected, from a newspaper I respected.
  Instead, the article was more a personal attack than a representation of our email exchange. Furthermore, even after
  the above exchange, the author preferred to quote the press release saying why I wouldn’t vote for the deal rather
  than our email exchange.
  Live and learn.
UPDATE:
Just read the rest of the NYTimes business section and couldn’t but help notice the irony of this
article: Corporate Law Class: First what
  not to do
The first day of class in Law School, the prof showed our HDNet
  Films documentary, Enron – The Smartest Guys in the Room, which
  I co-executive produced. It was used as an example of what not to do.
  To quote the professor – “The whole idea was to get them thinking about professional responsibility and professional
  ethics immediately.”
