5 cities and thousands and thousands of tapes have brought us a heck of a lot of choices to be among the 16 cast for The Benefactor.
We asked for all kinds of people and we have gotten them. In response to all the emails I have gotten, let me answer your questions.
1. We continue to go through tapes, we have NOT selected the final contestants yet.
2. We wont have even our real first cut down to 25 or 30 until we do.
3. Some people have been called asa follow up. If you have been called, congrats, ifyou havent, it doesnt mean you are out of it yet. There is a chance we havent seen your tape yet. We hope to have all the tapes reviewed by the end of this week
4.If by next week you havent heard back from us, your chances are slim, BUT, because the top 25 to 30 have to pass a variety of background checks (yep, we have to check out what was on your app), we probably end up cutting some folks from that group and may have to go back to our notes and pick the next set of potential contestants from there. So it aint over, till you see us make an announcement.
5. I cant place wildcard contestants, I cant give anyone special consideration. It doesnt matter what you say in an email, who you know,or what kind of pictures you send……We have to do it all by the book so everyone gets a fair shot.
the more I work on this, the more excited i get. Its going to be fun to be part of and just as much fun to watch !
