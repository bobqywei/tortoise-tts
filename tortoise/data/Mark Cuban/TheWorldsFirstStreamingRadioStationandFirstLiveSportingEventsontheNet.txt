[Dallas]…AudioNet, the world’s first audio network on the Internet, and KLIF 570AM, Dallas, are pleased to announce that on September 1st, 1995, KLIF became the first radio station in the world to begin broadcasting their original programming simultaneously over the air, and over the Internet.
Beginning with the broadcast of the Southern Methodist University Mustangs vs. the Arkansas Razorbacks college football game from the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, KLIF and AudioNet created history. Using Real Audio technology developed by Progressive Networks, along with networking and integration software designed and developed by AudioNet, the world’s first college football game simulnetcast was a complete success, coming off without a hitch.
“We were extremely pleased with the performance of the Real Audio software, as well as our own AudioNet software. We expected to run into a few glitches, but the support of the Progessive Network engineers, as well as our own teams, pulled the entire event off without any interruptions. More importantly we have been able to offer KLIF original programming, uninterrupted since that time”, said Mark Cuban, President of AudioNet.
“We are very pleased not only to be the first station broadcast on the Internet, but also to extend the reach of KLIF to many new listeners . The response of our listeners has been extermely favorable, as has the support of AudioNet,” said Dan Halyburton, Vice President/General Manager for KLIF.
