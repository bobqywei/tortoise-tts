One candidate thinks he can add value to solving the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression. The other candidate thinks he can’t add value and that its a better idea to campaign.
Here is the question I would ask the Senator: “How is it Senator Obama, that with Wall Street burning, you thought it was a better use of your time to campaign ?. You make it clear that one of your greatest skillsets is promoting consensus. Has there ever been a time when promoting consensus was more important to the financial health of the American people than today ?”
Even if all either Senator did  did was go to the meetings and shut up and listen, that would put both  in a position to offer help if needed.
Remember this. 90pct of being successful is showing up. The other 10pct is being prepared to  know what to do while you are there.
