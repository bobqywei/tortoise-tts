I don’t do a lot of promotion, but a buddy of mine has a blog. He actually worked on The Benefactor, so I think we are friends. Not the “call him up all the time and ask how he is doing” type of friend, but I think he would at least stop if I had a flat tire type of friend.If I were in LA and wanted to hang out type offriend…
More importantly, he has a blog. He likes to write about topics that you only think about to yourself when you are sitting at the dentist bored out of your mind and would never say out loud. The kind of inane things I love.
Plus he has some good gossip, that I have no idea if it’s true or not. But it sure is fun to read.
And since this was my first night to catch up on WFME since we finished shooting, it turns out to be a great source of a few tidbits from an insider that I didn’t even know about the show and how some of the crew, I mean my new best friends, felt about it.
Paul is a very talented guy. It’s a great read:
