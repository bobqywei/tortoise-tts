It was probably but just a matter of time ’till it happened, but I didn’t want it to go unnoticed. I got fined for my comments in a previous blog entry regarding opening night in the NBA.
I’m sure thisfine for a blog entryis a first in professional sports, and in a lot of respects it’s amusing and will be fun for others to write and talk about, but it raises a bigger question.
Do the customers and fans of the NBA or other leagues, feel it makes theleague appear stronger, weaker or unaffected when a player, owner, coach,GM, or executive publicly criticizes the league?
Are you as a consumer more likely to purchase, watch, recommend our products, or are you more likely to reduce your attachment and purchase of our products? How does it affect how you interact with us?
I’m curious about what the blogosphere thinks about the topic.
thanks
