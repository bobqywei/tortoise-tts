Letâ€™s put aside all these ridiculous rumors and put a stop to the just as crazy emails I have been getting from IU basketball fans.
I support Mike Davis. Without reserve.
As much as anyone I would like to see us back in the NCAA Finals where Coach Davis took us a few short years ago.
I think Coach Davis shot for the moon in his recruiting a little too much and saw his best incoming players going to the NBA. I think now he has adjusted his recruting approach andI LOVE the nucleus of freshman that we have and the progress they made over the course of the season.
Good job Coach Davis.
Go IU!
