SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Republican presidential candidate John McCain said Wednesday he will suspend his campaign to return to Washington to deal with the current bailout debate. McCain also called for a delay of Friday’s debate with Barack Obama, the first of three scheduled debates, to focus on the current financial crisis. 
Good for you Senator McCain. Thanks for reading my blog 🙂
