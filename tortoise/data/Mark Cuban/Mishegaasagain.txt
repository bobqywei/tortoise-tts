It’s been crazy, sleepless and fun the past few days.
Listening to everyone speculate about what the Lakers might do is always entertaining.
Listening to everyone speculate about what the Mavs might do is fun when it comes from fans. Love or hate what we do, might do, or have done, as long as fans have an opinion, that’s always a good thing. It shows passion, and Mavs fans are certainly passionate about our team.
Which leads to a question: In the Entertainment biz, they have very honest job descriptions. Someone who creates and reports gossip is called a gossip columnist. Joan Rivers, Page Six, Cindy Adams, etc. don’t pretend to be reporters. They get paid well to dish out gossip.
Can we please start calling the Sam Smiths and Peter Vesceys and Norman Chadsof the world what theyreallyare?Sports Gossip Columnists. They don’t have regard for the truth. Why pretend that they do?
It’s always these old favorites that seem to slime their way to the top. I was listening to the Dan Patrick Show and they had Sam Smith on, my buddy from the Chicago Tribune. Let’s just hope the accountants for the Tribune Company have a higher regard for accuracy in reporting than Sam the Sham does.
Perfect example of Sam in action is Jerry West going on the air during the draft saying the Grizz can’t afford to trade for Shaq. Then Sham chimes on the show saying Shaq is going to Memphis. Sam then does his daily rip on the Mavs and, in particular, our new draft pick, Pavel who he calls a stiff.
How about this for a challenge Sam the Sham Smith?…I will donate 10k dollars to the charity of your choice if you can prove that you have ever seen Pavel play in person or on tape  excluding the footage on the ESPN draft shows.Two minutesof ESPN tape doesn’t qualify as scouting. If you lose, you change your business card title and Tribune byline to “Sports Gossip Columnist”. I will even pay for the cards.
Doesn’t the Tribune Company realize that you are a blight on the entire company? I brought this up to an exec I met who works at the company. He told me they knew it, but that you were like the crazy oldunclethey had learned to live with. Great support from your company, Sam.
If they only knew how many times I have told brokers and possible investors that they shouldn’t buy Trib stock because if they can’t get simple details on their sports pages right, how can you trust their accountants? Corporate culture either values accuracy or it doesn’t. The Tribune Company obviously doesn’t.
******** Stop The Presses ********
No lie: After I wrote this blog entry, I sat down to read the NY Times and there in the business section is an article accusing (among others) the Tribune Company for inflating audited subscriber numbers…Maybe the company encourages Sam to lie…who knows…Is lyingpervasive at the Tribune Company? Corporate culture is amazingly powerful…
******** We now return to our regularly scheduled blog entry ********
Then of course there is Joan Rivers Vescey. Joan is wrong so often its hard to keep up. This week he wrote (calling itreporting would be so wrong…) that Steve Nash was mad at the Mavs because wehadn’t made an offer to him…Where in Europe did your “sources” talk to Steve? He has been on vacation since the end of the season, but I’m sure he is talking toyour”sources” instead ofvisiting theEiffel Tower. I guess I shouldignore theemails he has sent me and believe what you wroteinstead, Peter.
Where do you get this stuff? And why are you stupid enough to writeit as fact?Why are you so lazy that you have NEVER EVER called or emailed me to confirm a single thing you have written? Could it be that you don’t care about the truth? Aren’t you embarrassed that Page 6 in the Post has a better track record than you do?
And while we are on the topic of fantasy masquerading as fact, let me set everyone straight. The Mavs will not trade Dirk. We have never discussed a trade with Dirk or Steve for that matter.
As far as making additional trades, it’s no secret that we have discussed trading Antoine Walker. Walk did everything we asked of him this past year. He played every single position on the court  from point guard to center. He defended guys twice his size. He changed his game to fit our needs. He is an amazing talent.
While other players might have gotten upset or complained, Walk went to war for us. I can’t tell you how much respect I have for Walk, and what a positive he has been in the locker room and in representing the Mavs organization. It’s because he went to the wall for us that we told him that we would see if there was a better fit on another team. His flexibility was a big plus for us, but he would excel even further if he could find a specific role and focus on it.
We also told him that we wouldn’t just trade him just to move him. Guys who work as hard as Antoine  and are as versatile aren’t easy to come by.
I’m off to see our new guys workout. We play against China this week. I can’t wait to see Pavel against Yao!
One last thing: If comments on the blog get personal and aren’t on topic, they will be removed. If policing comments becomes a hassle, I will just turn them off.
