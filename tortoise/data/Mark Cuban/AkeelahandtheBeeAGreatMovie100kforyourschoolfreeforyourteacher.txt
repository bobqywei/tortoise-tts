Its always a great feeling when a movie Im involved with is more than just a movie, its a statement. Akeelah and the Bee is such a movie. Its a movie about learning to believe in yourself, realizing that obstacles can be opportunities and that with perserverance and hard work, anyone can reach their goals.
People say there arent enough family movies. Akeelah and the Bee is an amazing family movie. Its entertaining for anyone from 5 to 105. Its a movie that you can take young kids to and have good time, or somehow bribe your older kids to go with you and have a good time.
