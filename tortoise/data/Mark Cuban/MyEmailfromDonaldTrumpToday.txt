If this isn’t a briliant example of Trump marketing at its best, I dont know what is. All marketers can certainly learn from the following email I received this morning (i got it this morning.  despite the afternoon time.  A trick of spammers is to use a later time so it appears at the top of your webemail inbox which is for most people sorted by time received)
Hello, Donald Trump here.
 I am searching for a few like-minded people to share my personal wealth building strategies with, and I want you to be one of the first to hear about it.
 Please note, you are being extended a rare opportunity that can only be found on this web page.  It is important that you read this now, as it is a limited-time offer.

Thanks Donald. A spam email from Trump University and you. What could be better…Oh wait, i know. The multiples of this email that I found in my inbox today.
You really know how to lever the Trump brand !
Oh, BTW, where can I pick up Trump Vodka and how does it taste ?
