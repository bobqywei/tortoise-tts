absolutely nothing new to say.. did my workout.
  did an interview with Jalen Rose for Best Damn Sports Show. An interview from the gauntlet with a few.
  Big topic of conversation was my telling them that if we go 7 games , that rather than selling the 1400 or so tickets using the lottery system we have used to date. You know the one where every goes to the arena, gets a ticket, then we call out numbers and about 10k people are upset that their number didnt get called.  Then I get another 1k emails from people who tried to call or login online to buy tickets at exactly 10am and had everyone they know do the same, but couldnt buy tickets.
  Which in turn leads to another 1k emails about why tickets are available on Ebay , stubhub, etc for huge prices.
  I hate the process as much as everyone else. If we were greedy, the Mavs would just put the tickets up for auction and take in the full value the market assigns to them.
  But Im not that smart.
  Instead, we are looking at working with sponsors so that we can give away the 1500 or so tickets that we might be able to sell for a game 7.
  We will try to find a way with our sponsors to get them to fans. Of course , with that few tix available, 99 pct of the people who want to go wont be lucky enough to go. But with this system, we will require the name and address of the person who receives the ticket and require them to show Id when they get to arena so they cant sell them off.
  Hopefully it will work. Hopefully.
  Time to jump in the shower ! I can feel the electricity from the arena alreadyâ€¦
