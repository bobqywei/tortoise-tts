Im an investor in a company called Goowy Media. Its based in San Diego and is run by a bunch of smart guys who decided they were tired of everything on the net being built around HTML. So they decided to take Flash and turn it into a desktop environment. Their first product was Goowy.com . This past week they made a huge step forward when they introduced Yourminis.com .
Yourminis can be a lot of different things. A personal desktop. A Personal Homepage and more. But where Yourminis really shines is the ability to publish a personal page. Check out what I did to create a public personal homepage. It allows me to share (or not) things that Im doing that might be of interest to others. Kind of like myspace or facebook, but geared more towards sharing information rather than Which Victoria Secret Model Im most like. On my yourminis page I have some of the stocks I track. The searches and blogs I track. Some personal pictures. A video of the day from some of the fun things that people send me. 
What makes Yourminis publishing work really well for me is that it comes with a long and expanding list of widgets that make adding pictures, videos, searches, whatever to the page super easy. Plus it now has Firefox and IE7 extensions, which lets me capture a search I do or anything with an RSS or Calender or just about any microformat I encounter and quickly and easily add it to my page.
The site has only been up a week, so there is lots of upside for the project. Check out Yourminis.com, set up your own page, let us know what you think. And of course, check out my page and add some feedback
