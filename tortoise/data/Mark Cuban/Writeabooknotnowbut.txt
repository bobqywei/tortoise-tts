I appreciate all the inquiries asking about when I mightpublisha book about my approach to, and experiences in the business world. The short answer, not anytime soon.
Call it a firm belief in karma, but I just don’t think it’s smart or right topublish a book about business while I still have businesses that are in start up mode.
HDNet is going along very, very well. We are far beyond where I thought we would be at this point, but we aren’t all the way there yet. We have a lot of work to do, and the industry as a whole still has a lot of growing to do and we have to capture our share and then some.
I can’t see writing a book saying how smart I am, and how if you do this, you too can leap over tall bank accounts in a single bound and then have HDNet underperform.I can’t tell you how stupid I would feel. There is no amount of money (at this point in my life…) that would make it worthwhile. So no book from me until HDNet is where I want it to be at the earliest.
It amazes me that there are people out there that write books about business success while one or more of their businesses is failing.Maybe its financial desperation for the book advance?Who knows.To me its bad karma and hypocrisy.
Fortunately, I have BlogMaverick to present ideas and situations and get feedback from people on them. Of course you get exactly what you pay for. I get paid exactly what its worth…Which gives me carte blanche to write whatever I want….
