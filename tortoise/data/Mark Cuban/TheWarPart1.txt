One of our coaches, if we win walks in the locker room with a cookie and shakes all the guys hands and says the same thing “on the left”. The Win column is on the left. It doesnt matter how you got there. You got there.
  The Heat did a great job on us. Its obvious why Pat Riley has achieved the success he has. They took us out of some things, but seemed like every time they made a mistake, Jason Terry was there to capitalize on it.
  This is just one game. It feels great to win, but its just the first move in the chess match.
  Sunday, its on. The War Part 2
