Since a few people seem to be freaking out that I limited my example of those being subject to the bubble in private investments to Angels and Crowdfunding, I decided to do a part 2.
They were right. I should have been clearer on just how extensive the abuse and impact of this bubble is.
Lets change it to a question.
How many people have been pitched an app that is going to be the next ……..
How many people have been pitched to invest in that app ?
Has anyone not been pitched investing in an app ?
There are more than 1.3mm app in each of the 2 main stores. That excludes the dead and gone. That excludes the ones that never made it in.
I don’t know how many took in external PRIVATE investment from SMALL, individual investors.
I don’t know how many individuals in this country have made private investments in small deals while not being part of or self identifying as an Angel or Crowdfunding group. My guess is that its as big as the number of  non SOES day traders in 2000.
Does any one have any data I can use ?
I thought i would ask. I don’t want anyone to think i have lost touch with America :),
as always, I will take your responses and respond to as many questions as I can on Cyber Dust at
