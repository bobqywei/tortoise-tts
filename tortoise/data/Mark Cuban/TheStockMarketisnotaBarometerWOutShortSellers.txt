What the stock market does today or any day  until short selling is restored, will tell us NOTHING.
The pundits are going on CNBC, Fox, Fox Business, Bloomberg, etc and trying to give us some historic reference and relevance of the big declines in the market yesterday.  They are comparing apples to oranges.
Without short sellers, we have no idea what shares are actually worth.
Short Sellers keep markets honest.
A market without honesty, what can that tell us ? Nothing.
