We are just getting it up and running, but I wanted to post this info and give Facebook users a chance to check it out and email me on facebook with ideas and feedback. Check it out. Here is a link
Once i get the time, im going to sell off some of my dupes from my Technology Poster Collection. Back from my reseller days in the 80s and 90s, tech companies used to create posters for retailers. MicroSolutions wasnt a retailer but i got the posters and kept them. From early Apple to Banyan , NEC PCs, IBM PCjr, I got all kinds of cool stuff. No idea what they are worth, but this will be my chance to find out and pay a commission to anyone else who wants to help sell themâ€¦. 
Will also sell some unique Mavs memorabilia including the only existing Rodman Jerseys from his 11 days on the Mavs. Check out the app on Facebook
