Can someone please explain to me how and why Devin Harris is not even on the All Star Ballot ? I don’t know who actually puts the ballots together. Supposedly its a bunch of media members ( which may be all the explanation I need) who decide who is on or off. No matter, its a sure bet none of them has a future as a GM in this league.
Devin may not put up the gaudiest numbers game in and game out, but is there any question he is the best defensive point guard in the NBA ? Is there even a close second ?
Devin can stay in front of the quickest points in the league. Does a good a job as anyone getting over and around screens and defending the pick and roll and can guard bigger two guards when we need him to. 
Can you name any other point guard who is quick enough, smart enough  and willing enough to get in front of the likes of Tony Parker or Allen Iverson and take a charge like Devin does ?
It takes a lot to amaze me. Leaving Devin off the ballot amazes me….Hopefully NBA fans and coaches will be smart enough to recognize the mistake and vote him on to the All Star and All Defensive teams this summer…
