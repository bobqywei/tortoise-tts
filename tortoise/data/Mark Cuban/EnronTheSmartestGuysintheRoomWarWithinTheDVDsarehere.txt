For the many that have asked, Enron â€“ The Smartest Guys in the Room, the first movie from HDNEt Films will be available on DVD on January 17th. You can pre order it now from online stores like  Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and others.
  This is a GREAT movie. Its made quite a few Top 10 Movies of 2005 lists. It has been  named the top documentary of 2005 by several reviewers and associations.  .
  And if one movie isnt enough for you, dont forget to check out the DVD release for the War Within. It ships January 31st.
The War Within was easily one of the most controversial movies of 2005. Critics either loved it or hated, Fortunately , more loved it. There were untold crazies out there calling me names just because we made this movie. I loved it. Hopefully many of you will check it out for yourself and let me know what you think.
And for those of you, who like myself do not support the Hollywood approach to copy protection and fair use, ifyou buy a copy of either movie, check out the copy protection environment that we use.
