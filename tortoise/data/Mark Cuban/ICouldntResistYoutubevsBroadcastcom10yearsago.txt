After reading this on ValleyWag:
“YouTube, he told NewTeeVee, is only going to earn revenues of about $70 million to $90 million in 2008. InVideo ads – the kind Sanchez claimed Google ripped off – will be an even smaller part of the pie.”
I recognize this isn’t apples to apples. These are 1999 dollars, broadband penetration was dramatically lower back then and we weren’t an advertising supported mode, but then again, we didn’t pay to subsidize the bandwidth of every non commercial video on the internet and do everything we possibly could to avoid copyright law.
I just can’t help but post a link to my original article and a Broadcast.com quarterly release. If only we had today’s bandwidth costs back then…
