It’s time for my ref stat updates. As usual no names, no claims, just the facts and nothing more or less!
This week holds lots of fun facts that you can inspire your friends with.
Total fouls called are still up over last year, with an average of 48.17 in total fouls being called per game (compared to 42.73 last year).
The average number of calls by the 3 veteran officials who call the most total fouls is about 52, while the average of veteran officials who call the least fouls is about 44.
The average number of travels called this year is 2.1. (Thank you NBA for eliminating the “why don’t you call traveling, it’s a bad example” emails!) This compares to 1.52 at the end of last year.
Defensive 3 seconds is called on average .59 times per game. The average number ofcalls by the 3 veteran officials who call def 3 the most is 1.5x per game. The least, 0.18x per game, or a factor of about 8.
Offensive fouls are called on average 5.16 times per game. Theaverage number of calls by the 3 veteran officials who call offensive fouls the most is 7 per game. The least, 3.6 per game. Last years number was 3.9 per game.
There are .724 techs called per game this year compared to .762 per game last year. (His number will obviously be skewed by how many Mavericks games Joey Crawford officiates and Nellie gets vocal in  J.) The top and bottom averages are about 1.25 per game vs .33 per game.
Last by not least, is offensive 3 seconds. There are .794 called per game, vs .552 last year. The top and bottom averages are about 1.5 per game vs 0.30 game.
So now you know everything you always wanted to know about officiating statistics but were afraid to ask.
By reading this license agreement you agree to give me 25 pct of any bar bets won with this information.
