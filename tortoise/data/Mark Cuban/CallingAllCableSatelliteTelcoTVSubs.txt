I’m outraged and so you should be.
We work hard. We want the biggest selection of TV networks and on demand content that we can get. Preferably in beautiful high def. to enjoy on our new or planned HDTV.  We pay our bills.  We watch TV.
We watch it alone. We watch it with friends. We watch it on our schedule on our DVR. We watch it when scheduled so we can talk about it with our friends while we watch or after we watch. Why ? Because we know they are watching to. We don’t want to go through the hassle of searching through millions of different options when we can sit back and with a single hand, while we are on the couch, often with our favorite beverage in our non remote control hand, surf the entire universe of hundreds of channels offering thousands of hours. With one hand. When challenged we can talk on the phone, check a website and eat pizza, all with the other hand.
Those of us who enjoy this matter of life should be completely outraged that there are those who are leeching off the money we pay to enjoy tv.  Our check goes to pay our bill. The money then goes to pay for the tv network, which in turn goes to pay for the content. Its a system that works.
Like any good system, there are those that want to have their cake and eat it to. The content we pay for ? They want it for free.  We pay for it, they want it for free.
How is that fair ? Where is the justice ?
We pay for the content. We should be able to get it where we want it, and when we want it. Those who want  it for free ? They should pay too.
Call your cable/telco/satellite video provider and tell them you don’t think its fair that the content we pay for is available for free !
Content Payers Unite !
